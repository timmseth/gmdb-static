The map could provide clues as to which direction unlocks which room. For example there could be a fiery desert to the east and when pointed east the door leads to a kitchen, a room trapped with fireballs, a room filled with fire elementals, etc and to the northwest shows a depiction of a mermaid in the ocean and the door opens to a room with a siren inside when the arrow is in the northwest position, etc.",

The door only unlocks when the chains are untangled, however once removing a cap a strong (magnetic? Magic?) force pulls the cap to the pegs.

It can just barely be seen through at the top as the smoke fades. Trying to pass through the smoke door causes fire damage and repels the creature.

A sufficiently random, arbitrary sequence of prime numbers in hexatridecimal is required to open the door. It is magically enchanted to use the spell 'SENDING' up to 5 times per day to say cutting, vulgar, mean, and highly insulting things at you until you discover a sequence that will open it.

It requires strength check to resist it's pull when within 10 feet of the door or to pass through it's frame.

 "A door with a mirrored surface. No handle is visible upon inspection. The door perfectly reflects what is in front of it. Only in complete darkness may the door be passed through. Extinguishing all light and removing the doors ability to reflect anything will cause the door to de-materialize. Any source of light will cause the door to reappear and block the path. Any form of Darkvision must be blocked as well, those who possess it must close their eyes, drop the spell, etc...",

 "A perfectly normal, open door. Completely wide open. But it looks just like a door in your life that you have only ever seen closed. You know this door is open, but looking at it; you can't get passed the feeling that the door is, and always has been closed. You refuse to walk through it until someone performs the 'opening the door for you' gesture. (Basically the dog not accepting that the sliding door is, in fact, open.)",
 "The door has a large keyhole in the center of it and on the other side of the room is a sentient stone head with a key as their nose. In order to open the door, the PCs must trick the head into telling a lie, when they do so the nose extends and unlocks the door.",
 "A somewhat cracked looking wooden door. The door actually has a severe case of dry rot. If someone tries the handle, it just falls off the door. If anyone applies enough force to open the door, the door just crumbles to dust and splinters.",
 "The door is made from one solid piece of an unusual substance (bone, ceramic, chitin, obsidian, monster scale).");
$a_dungeon_room=array("A crack in the ceiling above the middle of the north wall allows a trickle of water to flow down to the floor. The water pools near the base of the wall, and a rivulet runs along the wall an out into the hall. The water smells fresh.",
 "Thick cobwebs fill the corners of the room, and wisps of webbing hang from the ceiling and waver in a wind you can barely feel. One corner of the ceiling has a particularly large clot of webbing within which a goblin's bones are tangled.",
 "Tapestries decorate the walls of this room. Although they may once have been brilliant in hue, they now hang in graying tatters. Despite the damage of time and neglect, you can perceive once-grand images of wizards' towers, magical beasts, and symbols of spellcasting. The tapestry that is in the best condition bulges out weirdly, as though someone stands behind it (an armless statue of a female human spellcaster).",
 "Rats inside the room shriek when they hear the door open, then they run in all directions from a putrid corpse lying in the center of the floor. As these creatures crowd around the edges of the room, seeking to crawl through a hole in one corner, they fight one another. The stinking corpse in the middle of the room looks human, but the damage both time and the rats have wrought are enough to make determining its race by appearance an extremely difficult task at best.",
 "Neither light nor darkvision can penetrate the gloom in this chamber. An unnatural shade fills it, and the room's farthest reaches are barely visible. Near the room's center, you can just barely perceive a lump about the size of a human lying on the floor. (It might be a dead body, a pile of rags, or a sleeping monster that can take advantage of the room's darkness.) <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The darkness can come from a deeper darkness spell effect.",
 "Burning torches in iron sconces line the walls of this room, lighting it brilliantly. At the room's center lies a squat stone altar, its top covered in recently spilled blood. A channel in the altar funnels the blood down its side to the floor where it fills grooves in the floor that trace some kind of pattern or symbol around the altar. Unfortunately, you can't tell what it is from your vantage point.",
 "A liquid-filled pit extends to every wall of this chamber. The liquid lies about 10 feet below your feet and is so murky that you can't see its bottom. The room smells sour. A rope bridge extends from your door to the room's other exit.",
 "Fire crackles and pops in a small cooking fire set in the center of the room. The smoke from a burning rat on a spit curls up through a hole in the ceiling. Around the fire lie several fur blankets and a bag. It looks like someone camped here until not long ago, but then left in a hurry.",
 "A flurry of bats suddenly flaps through the doorway, their screeching barely audible as they careen past your heads. They flap past you into the rooms and halls beyond. The room from which they came seems barren at first glance.",
 "Rusting spikes line the walls and ceiling of this chamber. The dusty floor shows no sign that the walls move over it, but you can see the skeleton of some humanoid impaled on some wall spikes nearby.",
 "You open the door, and the reek of garbage assaults your nose. Looking inside, you see a pile of refuse and offal that nearly reaches the ceiling. In the ceiling above it is a small hole that is roughly as wide as two human hands. No doubt some city dweller high above disposes of his rubbish without ever thinking about where it goes.",
 "You open the door, and the room comes alive with light and music. A sourceless, warm glow suffuses the chamber, and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds. Unfortunately, the rest of the chamber isn't so inviting. The floor is strewn with the smashed remains of rotting furniture. It looks like the room once held a bed, a desk, a chest, and a chair.",
 "A skeleton dressed in moth-eaten garb lies before a large open chest in the rear of this chamber. The chest is empty, but you note two needles projecting from the now-open lock. Dust coats something sticky on the needles' points.",
 "Rounded green stones set in the floor form a snake's head that points in the direction of the doorway you stand in. The body of the snake flows back and toward the wall to go round about the room in ever smaller circles, creating a spiral pattern on the floor. Similar green-stone snakes wend along the walls, seemingly at random heights, and their long bodies make wave shapes.",
 "The manacles set into the walls of this room give you the distinct impression that it was used as a prison and torture chamber, although you can see no evidence of torture devices. One particularly large set of manacles -- big enough for an ogre -- have been broken open.",
 "You gaze into the room and hundreds of skulls gaze coldly back at you. They're set in niches in the walls in a checkerboard pattern, each skull bearing a half-melted candle on its head. The grinning bones stare vacantly into the room, which otherwise seems empty.",
 "Unlike the flagstone common throughout the dungeon, this room is walled and floored with black marble veined with white. The ceiling is similarly marbled, but the thick pillars that hold it up are white. A brown stain drips down one side of a nearby pillar. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The stain could be old blood.",
 "A huge iron cage lies on its side in this room, and its gate rests open on the floor. A broken chain lies under the door, and the cage is on a rotting corpse that looks to be a hobgoblin. Another corpse lies a short distance away from the cage. It lacks a head.",
 "This room is a tomb. Stone sarcophagi stand in five rows of three, each carved with the visage of a warrior lying in state. In their center, one sarcophagus stands taller than the rest. Held up by six squat pillars, its stone bears the carving of a beautiful woman who seems more asleep than dead. The carving of the warriors is skillful but seems perfunctory compared to the love a sculptor must have lavished upon the lifelike carving of the woman.",
 "A dim bluish light suffuses this chamber, its source obvious at a glance. Blue-glowing lichen and violet-glowing moss cling to the ceiling and spread across the floor. It even creeps down and up each wall, as if the colonies on the floor and ceiling are growing to meet each other. Their source seems to be a glowing, narrow crack in the ceiling, the extent of which you cannot gauge from your position. The air in the room smells fresh and damp.",
 "You open the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling, and each hole is roughly a foot wide. The water pours in columns that fall through similar holes in the floor, flowing down to some unknown depth. Each of the eight pillars of water drops as much liquid as a stream in winter thaw. The floor is damp and looks slippery.",
 "This room smells strange, no doubt due to the weird sheets of black slime that drip from cracks in the ceiling and spread across the floor. The slime seeps from the shattered stone of the ceiling at a snails crawl, forming a mess of dangling walls of gook. As you watch, a bit of the stuff separates from a sheet and drops to the ground with a wet plop.",
 "This room is hung with hundreds of dusty tapestries. All show signs of wear: moth holes, scorch marks, dark stains, and the damage of years of neglect. They hang on all the walls and hang from the ceiling to brush against the floor, blocking your view of the rest of the room.",
 "You catch a whiff of the unmistakable metallic tang of blood as you open the door. The floor is covered with it, and splashes of blood spatter the walls. Some drops even reach the ceiling. It looks fresh, but you don't see any bodies or footprints leaving the chamber.",
 "Three low, oblong piles of rubble lie near the center of this small room. Each has a weapon jutting upright from one end -- a longsword, a spear, and a quarterstaff. The piles resemble cairns used to bury dead adventurers.",
 "Huge rusted metal blades jut out of cracks in the walls, and rusting spikes project down from the ceiling almost to the floor. This room may have once been trapped heavily, but someone triggered them, apparently without getting killed. The traps were never reset and now seem rusted in place.",
 "Several round pits lie in the floor of the room before you. Spaced roughly equally apart, each is about 15 feet in diameter and appears about 20 feet deep. A lattice of thick iron bars covers the top of each pit, and each lattice has a door of iron bars that can be lifted open. The pits smell of sweat and offal, but the room seems unoccupied.",
 "Many doors fill the room ahead. Doors of varied shape, size, and design are set in every wall and even the ceiling and floor. Barely a hand's width lies between one door and the next. All the doors but the one you entered by are shut, and many have obvious locks.",
 "A strange ceiling is the focal point of the room before you. It's honeycombed with hundreds of holes about as wide as your head. They seem to penetrate the ceiling to some height beyond a couple feet, but you can't be sure from your vantage point.",
 "This chamber was clearly smaller at one time, but something knocked down the wall that separated it from an adjacent room. Looking into that space, you see signs of another wall knocked over. It doesn't appear that anyone made an effort to clean up the rubble, but some paths through see more usage than others.",
 "A chill wind blows against you as you open the door. Beyond it, you see that the floor and ceiling are nothing but iron grates. Above and below the grates the walls extend up and down with no true ceiling or floor within your range of vision. It's as though the chamber is a bridge through the shaft of a great well. Standing on the edge of this shaft, you feel a chill wind pass down it and over your shoulder into the hall beyond.",
 "This room is shattered. A huge crevasse shears the chamber in half, and the ground and ceilings are tilted away from it. It's as though the room was gripped in two enormous hands and broken like a loaf of bread. Someone has torn a tall stone door from its hinges somewhere else in the dungeon and used it to bridge the 15-foot gap of the chasm between the two sides of the room. Whatever did that must have possessed tremendous strength because the door is huge, and the enormous hinges look bent and mangled.",
 "A pit yawns open before you just on the other side of the door's threshold. The entire floor of the room has fallen into a second room beneath it. Across the way you can spy a door in the wall now 15 feet off the rubble-strewn floor, and near the center of the room stands a thick column of mortared stone that appears to hold the spiral staircase that leads down to what was the lower level.",
 "As the door opens, it scrapes up frost from a floor covered in ice. The room before you looks like an ice cave. A tunnel wends its way through solid ice, and huge icicles and pillars of frozen water block your vision of its farthest reaches.",
 "A 30-foot-tall demonic idol dominates this room of black stone. The potbellied statue is made of red stone, and its grinning face holds what looks to be two large rubies in place of eyes. A fire burns merrily in a wide brazier the idol holds in its lap.",
 "Several exits lead from this room, but only one is within the mouth of a man. The door opposite you stands within an intricate stone carving of a man's wide-open mouth. The man's nose and eyes loom over the door while his sculpted hair splays out across the wall on either side.",
 "The door creaks open, which somewhat overshadows the sound of bubbling liquid. Before you is a room about which alchemists dream. Three tables bend beneath a clutter of bottles of liquid and connected glass piping. Several bookshelves stand nearby stuffed to overfilling with a jumble of books, jars, bottles, bags, and boxes. The alchemist who set this all up doesn't seem to be present, but a beaker of green fluid boils over a burner on one of the tables.",
 "The scent of earthy decay assaults your nose upon peering through the open door to this room. Smashed bookcases and their sundered contents litter the floor. Paper rots in mold-spotted heaps, and shattered wood grows white fungus.",
 "Several white marble busts that rest on white pillars dominate this room. Most appear to be male or female humans of middle age, but one clearly bears small horns projecting from its forehead and another is spread across the floor in a thousand pieces, leaving one pillar empty.",
 "A dozen statues stand or kneel in this room, and each one lacks a head and stands in a posture of action or defense. All are garbed for battle. It's difficult to tell for sure without their heads, but two appear to be dwarves, one might be an elf, six appear human, and the rest look like they might be orcs.",
 "A rusted portcullis stands just beyond the door. Looking into the room, you see three other exits, similarly blocked by portcullises. Four skeletons dressed in aged clothing and rusting armor lie on the floor in the room against the walls. They seem in poses of repose rather than violence.",
 "This tiny room holds a curious array of machinery. Winches and levers project from every wall, and chains with handles dangle from the ceiling. On a nearby wall, you note a pictogram of what looks like a scythe on a chain. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This room may be a control center for traps elsewhere in the dungeon.",
 "This narrow room at first appears to be a dead-end corridor, but then you note several metal plates on the walls set at about eye height. Looking more closely, you see that one of these plates is slid aside to reveal a peephole.",
 "You open the door to a scene of carnage. Two male humans, a male elf, and a female dwarf lie in drying pools of their blood. It seems that they might once have been wearing armor, except for the elf, who remains dressed in a blue robe. Clearly they lost some battle and victors stripped them of their valuables.",
 "The door in front of you seems to be stuck. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs yank it open, it comes open. Read the following: A furious rumble resounds in the area as stones come clattering through the doorway, along with a thick cloud of rock dust. The room beyond is filled with rubble.",
 "This chamber served as an armory for some group of creatures. Armor and weapon racks line the walls and rusty and broken weapons litter the floor. It hasn't been used in a long time, and all the useful weapons have been taken but for a single sword. Unlike the other weapons in the room, this one gleams untarnished in the light.",
 "There's a hiss as you open this door, and you smell a sour odor, like something rotten or fermented. Inside you see a small room lined with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels. It looks like someone once used this place as a larder, but it has been a long time since anyone came to retrieve food from it.",
 "A horrendous, overwhelming stench wafts from the room before you. Small cages containing small animals and large insects line the walls. Some of the creatures look sickly and alive but most are clearly dead. Their rotting corpses and the unclean cages no doubt result in the zoo's foul odor. A cat mews weakly from its cage, but the other creatures just silently shrink back into their filthy prisons.",
 "A cluster of low crates surrounds a barrel in the center of this chamber. Atop the barrel lies a stack of copper coins and two stacks of cards, one face up. Meanwhile, atop each crate rests a fan of five face-down playing cards. A thin layer of dust covers everything. Clearly someone meant to return to their game of cards.",
 "This chamber of well-laid stones holds a wide bas-relief of a pastoral scene. In it you see a mountain like Mount Waterdeep, except that Castle Waterdeep and the city are missing. Instead, a small fishing village is a short way from a walled complex with several tall towers.",
 "A stone throne stands on a foot-high circular dais in the center of this cold chamber. The throne and dais bear the simple adornments of patterns of crossed lines -- a pattern also employed around each door to the room.",
 "A wall that holds a seat with a hole in it is in this chamber. It's a privy! The noisome stench from the hole leads you to believe that the privy sees regular use.",
 "The burble of water reaches your ears after you open the door to this room. You see the source of the noise in the far wall: a large fountain artfully carved to look like a seashell with the figure of a seacat spewing clear water into its basin.",
 "This room holds six dry circular basins large enough to hold a man and a dry fountain at its center. All possess chipped carvings of merfolk and other sea creatures. It looks like this room once served some group of people as a bath.",
 "A glow escapes this room through its open doorways. The masonry between every stone emanates an unnatural orange radiance. Glancing quickly about the room, you note that each stone bears the carving of someone's name. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Consider putting the name of one of your party's characters on the wall.",
 "A huge stewpot hangs from a thick iron tripod over a crackling fire in the center of this chamber. A hole in the ceiling allows some of the smoke from the fire to escape, but much of it expands across the ceiling and rolls down to fill the room in a dark fog. Other details are difficult to make out, but some creature must be nearby, because it smells like a good soup is cooking.",
 "You've opened the door to a torture chamber. Several devices of degradation, pain, and death stand about the room, all of them showing signs of regular use. The wood of the rack is worn smooth by struggling bodies, and the iron maiden appears to be occupied by a corpse.",
 "This short hall leads to another door. On either side of the hall, niches are set into the wall within which stand clay urns. One of the urns has been shattered, and its contents have spilled onto its shelf and the floor. Amid the ash it held, you see blackened chunks of something that might be bone.",
 "Corpses and pieces of corpses hang from hooks that dangle from chains attached to thick iron rings. Most appear humanoid but a few of the body parts appear more monstrous. You don't see any heads, hands, or feet -- all seem to have been chopped or torn off. Neither do you see any guts in the horrible array, but several thick leather sacks hang from hooks in the walls, and they are suspiciously wet and the leather looks extremely taut -- as if it' under great strain.",
 "This small chamber seems divided into three parts. The first has several hooks on the walls from which hang dusty robes. An open curtain separates that space from the next, which has a dry basin set in the floor. Beyond that lies another parted curtain behind which you can see several straw mats in a semicircle pointing toward a statue of a dog-headed man. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The first part of the room may have been used for changing and cleaning feet before entering the room with the statue.",
 "When looking into this chamber, you're confronted by a thousand reflections of yourself looking back. Mirrored walls set at different angles fill the room. A path seems to wind through the mirrors, although you can't tell where it leads.",
 "A large forge squats against the far wall of this room, and coals glow dimly inside. Before the forge stands a wide block of iron with a heavy-looking hammer lying atop it, no doubt for use in pounding out shapes in hot metal. Other forge tools hang in racks nearby, and a barrel of water and bellows rest on the floor nearby.",
 "This chamber is clearly a prison. Small barred cells line the walls, leaving a 15-foot-wide pathway for a guard to walk. Channels run down either side of the path next to the cages, probably to allow the prisoners' waste to flow through the grates on the other side of the room. The cells appear empty but your vantage point doesn't allow you to see the full extent of them all.",
 "You push open the stone door to this room and note that the only other exit is a door made of wood. It and the table shoved against it are warped and swollen. Indeed, the table only barely deserves that description. Its surface is rippled into waves and one leg doesn't even touch the floor. The door shows signs of someone trying to chop through from the other side, but it looks like they gave up.",
 "This otherwise bare room has one distinguishing feature. The stone around one of the other doors has been pulled over its edges, as though the rock were as soft as clay and could be moved with fingers. The stone of the door and wall seems hastily molded together.",
 "You enter a small room and your steps echo. Looking about, you're uncertain why, but then a wall vanishes and reveals an enormous chamber. The wall was an illusion and whoever cast it must be nearby!",
 "You feel a sense of foreboding upon peering into this cavernous chamber. At its center lies a low heap of refuse, rubble, and bones atop which sit several huge broken eggshells. Judging by their shattered remains, the eggs were big enough to hold a crouching man, making you wonder how large -- and where -- the mother is.",
 "This small chamber is a bloody mess. The corpse of a minotaur lies on the floor, its belly carved out. The creature's innards are largely missing, and yet you detect no other wounds. Bloody, froglike footprints track away from the corpse and out an open door.",
 "A chill crawls up your spine and out over your skin as you look upon this room. The carvings on the wall are magnificent, a symphony in stonework -- but given the themes represented, it might be better described as a requiem. Scenes of death, both violent and peaceful, appear on every wall framed by grinning skeletons and ghoulish forms in ragged cloaks.",
 "A pungent, earthy odor greets you as you pull open the door and peer into this room. Mushrooms grow in clusters of hundreds all over the floor. Looking into the room is like looking down on a forest. Tall tangles of fungus resemble forested hills, the barren floor looks like a plain between the woods, and even a trickle of water and a puddle of water that pools in a low spot bears a resemblance to a river and lake, respectively.",
 "You pull open the door and hear the scrape of its opening echo throughout what must be a massive room. Peering inside, you see a vast cavern. Stalactites drip down from the ceiling in sharp points while flowstone makes strange shapes on the floor.",
 "You find this chamber lit dimly by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax. The smell of their smoke hits your nose along with an odor that is reminiscent of the sea. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor with the candles situated equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight.",
 "This chamber holds one occupant: the statue of a male figure with elven features but the broad, muscular body of a hale human. It kneels on the floor as though fallen to that posture. Both its arms reach upward in supplication, and its face is a mask of grief. Two great feathered wings droop from its back, both sculpted to look broken. The statue is skillfully crafted.",
 "The door to this room swings open easily on well-oiled hinges. Beyond it you see that the chamber walls have been disguised by wood paneling, and the stone ceiling and floor are hidden by bright marble tiles. Several large and well-stuffed chairs are arranged about the room along with some small reading tables.",
 "Many small desks with high-backed chairs stand in three long rows in this room. Each desk has an inkwell, book stand, and a partially melted candle in a rusting tin candleholder. Everything is covered with dust. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The room could have been a scriptorium at some point.",
 "You round the corner to see a ghastly scene. A semitranslucent figure hangs in the air, studded with crossbow bolts and with blood pouring from every wound. It reaches toward you in a pleading gesture, points to the walls on either side of the room, and then vanishes. Once it has gone, you notice small holes in the walls, each just large enough for a bolt to pass through.",
 "You open the door and before you is a dragon's hoard of treasure. Coins cover every inch of the room, and jeweled objects of precious metal jut up from the money like glittering islands in a sea of gold. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Taking one step in the room alerts the PCs to the disappointing truth. Their feet pass silently through the illusion of the coins to strike the solid floor beneath.",
 "You open the door to reveal a 10-foot-by-10-foot room with a floor studded with spikes. The bones of some creature lie among the spikes and some insects scuttle away from the desiccated remains. No other doors are in the room, and it appears the door you opened was created to blend in with the walls. Additionally, you see no ceiling. You must be at the bottom of a very deep spiked pit.",
 "You open the door to a long narrow room with a high ceiling. Three thick circles of wood rest on wooden stands. You're not certain what they are because you came into the room behind them. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs step in the room to get a better look, they see that each is painted with concentric circles marred by dozens of cuts into its surface. They're targets, and the PCs are on the wrong end of an archery range.",
 "You open the door to what must be a combat training room. Rough fighting circles are scratched into the surface of the floor. Wooden fighting dummies stand waiting for someone to attack them. A few punching bags hang from the ceiling. There's something peculiar about it all though. Every dummy is stocky and each has a bedraggled piece of leather hanging from its head that could be a long mask or a beard.",
 "This small room contains several pieces of well-polished wood furniture. Eight ornate, high-backed chairs surround a long oval table, and a side table stands next to the far exit. All bear delicate carvings of various shapes. One bears carvings of skulls and bones, another is carved with shields and magic circles, and a third is carved with shapes like flames and lightning strokes. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The eight chairs represent the eight schools of magic.",
 "The strong, sour-sweet scent of vinegar assaults your nose as you enter this room. Sundered casks and broken bottle glass line the walls of this room. Clearly this was someone's wine cellar for a time. The shards of glass are somewhat dusty, and the spilled wine is nothing more than a sticky residue in some places. Only one small barrel remains unbroken amid the rubbish.",
 "Looking into this room, you note four pits in the floor. A wide square is nearest you, a triangular pit beyond it, and a little farther than both lie two circular pits. The room is rectangular nearest you but it widens into a larger rounded chamber starting just beyond the rectangular pit. You note that many flagstones, ceiling tiles, and wall blocks are carved with a skull emblem of some kind, whose dark openings emulate the layout of the pits. You've opened a door in the \"chin\" and are looking up at the face.",
 "This room looks like it was designed by drow. Rusted metal tiles create a huge mosaic of a spider in the floor, and someone set up rusted gratings like draperies of webs. At the far end of the chamber, the carving of a spider squats on the floor. It's about 3 feet tall and seems molded into the floor. Beyond it stands tall double doors of stone, their surface covered in a glittering web of gold.",
 "You peer through the open doorway into a broad, pillared hall. The columns of stone are carved as tree trunks and seem placed at random like trees in a forest. Stone root systems crawl out into the floor and marble branches expand across the ceiling. You even note a few carvings of small birds and squirrels. Beautiful as they are, the sculpting doesn't appear elven, and it's nothing dwarves would carve.",
 "This small room is lined with benchlike seats on all the walls. The seats all have holes in their top, like a privy. Facing stones on the front of the benches prevent you from seeing how deep the holes go. It looks like a communal bathroom. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> The PCs may have heard that these are common in Chessenta, but that country is hundreds of miles to the east and south.",
 "In the center of this large room lies a 30-foot-wide round pit, its edges lined with rusting iron spikes. About 5 feet away from the pit's edge stand several stone semicircular benches. The scent of sweat and blood lingers, which makes the pit's resemblance to a fighting pit or gladiatorial arena even stronger.",
 "This room is a small antechamber before two titanic bronze doors. Each stands 20 feet tall and is about 7 feet wide. The double doors are peaked at their centers, but unlike many sets of double doors, their division isn't in the center. Instead, the crack between the doors resembles a crooked bolt of lightning, which a figure in a cloud carved in the stone above the door appears to be hurling. The lightning bolt strikes down roughly 2 feet to the right of center. The figure in the clouds is deliberately indistinct, but it appears male, having a beard and male proportions. The stroke of bronze electricity hits a tower that seems small compared to the figure. This tower cracks down the center, continuing the gap between the doors until it reaches the ground. To either side of the tower lie pastoral scenes of hillsides dotted with sheep. There doesn't appear to be a lock or handles.",
 "You poke your head through the break in the wall and look upon a room of titanic size. It is clearly an enormous mausoleum built to the proportions of giants. Huge niches are set into the walls within which you can discern giant bones. Stern-looking statues of stone giants stand 20 feet tall against the walls, and in the center of the room lies a 15-foot-long sarcophagus.",
 "This chamber holds an odd contraption of metal and wood. It's a 20-foot-diameter circular platform that is tilted heavily to one side. Beneath it you can discern mechanisms that seem to attach to a large crank not far away. Above the platform hang metal weights on thin chains, which in turn are attached to discs and belts that are attached to other winches. It seems as though turning the winches turns and tilts the platform and sets the weights to moving. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This could be a training room for combat, but the PCs don't see any weapons inside. Certainly it would take a great deal of concentration to fight on the platform; perhaps it's a training room for monks or spellcasters.",
 "You inhale a briny smell like the sea as you crack open the door to this chamber. Within you spy the source of the scent: a dark and still pool of brackish water within a low circular wall. Above it stands a strange statue of a lobster-headed and clawed woman. The statue is nearly 15 feet tall and holds the lobster claws crossed over its naked breasts.",
 "Stinking smoke wafts up from braziers made of skulls set around the edges of this room. The walls bear scratch marks and lines of soot that form crude pictures and what looks like words in some language [Goblin]. To the left lies a pile of rubbish and rubble heaped into a crude dais. The dais has upon it an ironbound chest that has been painted with a goblinlike face. Furs and skins of unknown origin are strewn haphazardly about the floor before the dais.",
 "This small bare chamber holds nothing but a large ironbound chest, which is big enough for a man to fit in and bears a heavy iron lock. The floor has a layer of undisturbed dust upon it.",
 "This hall is choked with corpses. The bodies of orcs and ogres lie in tangled heaps where they died, and the floor is sticky with dried blood. It looks like the orcs and ogres were fighting. Some side was the victor but you're not sure which one. The bodies are largely stripped of valuables, but a few broken weapons jut from the slain or lie discarded on the floor.",
 "You round the corner of the hall to confront a passage nearly blocked with crates, barrels, and chests. It seems someone set them up to barricade the hall. Three barrels are set up as seats near gaps in the barricade, no doubt the place where archers waited for foes. A rusting and torn breastplate hangs from a rope near the wall. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> Perhaps the breastplate served as a warning gong.",
 "You smelled smoke as you moved down the hall, and rounding the corner into this room you see why. Every surface bears scorch marks and ash piles on the floor. The room reeks of fire and burnt flesh. Either a great battle happened here or the room bears some fire danger you cannot see for no flames light the room anymore.",
 "This hall stinks with the wet, pungent scent of mildew. Black mold grows in tangled veins across the walls and parts of the floor. Despite the smell, it looks like it might be safe to travel through. A path of stone clean of mold wends its way through the hallway.",
 "You open the door and a gout of flame rushes at your face. A wave of heat strikes you at the same time and light fills the hall. The room beyond the door is ablaze! An inferno engulfs the place, clinging to bare rock and burning without fuel.",
 "You peer into this room and spot the white orb of a skull lying on the floor. Suddenly a stone falls from the ceiling and smashes the skull to pieces. An instant later, another stone from the ceiling drops to strike the floor and shatter. You hear a low rumbling and cracking noise. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The ceiling caves in during the next round.",
 "Dozens of dead, winged beings lie scattered about the floor, each about the size of a cat. Their broken bodies are batlike and buglike at the same time. Each had two sets of bat wings, a long nose like a mosquito, and six legs, but many were split in half or had limbs or wings lopped off. Their forms are little more than dried husks now, and there's no sign of what killed them.");
$a_familiar_or_pet=array("A young dragon that was permanently shrunk by cursed magic, and is unable to speak in any form. Will take hundreds of years to mature and is learning magic by being a familiar and observing spellcasters so as to learn how to undo his curse.",

 "A normal familiar creature, but with a pouch on its belly, where it keeps various trinkets and valuables. Obsessively steals trinkets and valuables if left unattended.",
 "A tumor that has grown on the spellcaster, has a tiny mouth and grows sparse hair, may have an eye or two. It posses its own brain and has an excellent memory, but little intelligence. can recite spells perfectly but lacks the intellect to carry a conversation or ask any questions.",
 "A tiny construct that chirps and whirrs as it flys around. Possesses a small glass orb of magic that may be used for scrying. Prefers spellcasters with missing arms or hands, so it can change shape and take the form of the casters appendage for as long as it desires to.",
 "A small fire elemental vanished from the plane of fire shaped like a black cat, leaves black ashen tracks everywhere it goes. It can be commanded to summon its tiny fire powers to explode damaging everything around it, but like most cats, is temperamental and difficult to control or command.",

 "A particularly spiteful faery thats run away from home and latched onto you because it likes the color of your eyes. Occasionally changes your hair color in the middle of the night and refuses to be told what to cast or when.",
 "An egg, with legs. Nobodys been able to crack the shell yet, but its convinced youre its mother, and will probably attempt to eat the rest of the party when it comes out of its shell.",
 "A tiny alligator. Like ridiculously tiny, three inches long at most. The only way you can tell it apart from a newt is it occasionally latches onto a finger and draws blood. But its very good at sneaking into and out of places.",
 "Micro-dragon. If it curls up, it fits into the palm of your hand. You found it in your gold pouch one day clutching a single gold piece, and it refuses to let go. Can produce a small flame as with Prestidigitation.",

 "A baby. For everyone else, this IS a baby; to the owner, it is a living embodiment of their own magical will. It cannot be killed by mundane or magical means, and for all intents and purposes is indestructible; but if the spellcaster is damaged, the baby is damaged (which also means, if the spellcaster dies, the baby dies). Think Portrait of Dorian Gray, kinda. Additional: a psychic link between caster and baby reveals the baby is himself--and thus, can converse with the baby/himself psychically or verbally (but the baby cannot speak, itself). It is able to move--crawl--up to a few meters away, and can share what it sees with the caster. Basically, it can do baby things, and obeys commands that the caster gives it, to the physical limit of a baby. Note-slash-edit: using the baby as an object (re: Ill just go around and beat everyone with it then!) saps the spellcaster of any goodness inside them--the more evil they become, the more blackened, bruised, and ugly the baby gets.",
 "A lion turtle (yeah, THAT lion turtle. Not super huge, as it aint too old yet--think average tortoise-sized. Which, I also suppose, means its still in its infancy?). Can either: hold extra spell slots for the caster, or turn one spell per day into a spell level higher (turtles choice--which, really, is GMs choice), cast a random spell as needed, or finally, lets its owner reroll a saving throw (boost of luck).",

 "Bees. You wear their queen in a golden amber oval around your neck; it cannot be stolen, as it has adhered to your flesh (it just LOOKS like its a necklace). Eating/drinking your hives honey imbues more magical potency. Making/drinking mead doubles it (but, its mead, so itll getcha drunk).

 "A large parrot that is able to translate the more common languages, but yells the translation directly into the spellcasters Ear.",
 "A small cat-sized Owlbear that has a natural aptitude for finding things (+1 on investigation rolls). Like most Owlbears it has a large appetite and is almost constantly hungry. If its left unfed for too long it tends to be temperamental (doesnt help in investigations) and, for some reason, makes attempts to eat the shoes of the spellcaster.",
 "A Kua-toa child. Fiercely loyal to the caster and views them as a divine figure. They can manifest minor clerical powers through their devotion alone.",
 "A boggle that started off as the characters childhood imaginary friend, then slowly grew in power. The boggle can become very resentful if the character seems to be making friends with someone new.",
 "A sentient clam that happily babbles in an unknown language, assumedly Clam. It sings amazingly despite its incomprehensible language, and has advantage on all performance checks involving singing. A patient spellcaster may be able to pick up the language if they are persistent.",
 "A will-o-wisp that has taken an interest in the spellcaster and follows them of its own free will. It is mischevious and a tad cruel by nature, and occasionally floats off for hours at a time before returning. It often zaps party members at inoppurtune times, and lingers after fights to consume the souls of the fallen. That aside, it is still supportive of the caster and readily provides backup as a distraction during truly dire combat. It occasionally acts as a guide when the spellcaster is lost, though it will sometimes play tricks on the caster in the same way. When the spellcaster is casting a spell, the will-o-wisp circles the caster at rapid speeds, and will add an additional 2d8 of lightning damage to it if the spell also does lighting damage.",
 "A sentient transparent orb filled with smoke, that also doubles as a spellcasting focus for the caster. It communicates through movement of the smoke, with peaceful drifting indicating contentment and violent swirling indicating agitation. After gaining trust in the spellcaster over a long period of time, the spellcaster will begin to see pictures in the smoke that only they can see, which hint at the history of the orb.",
 "An oddly colored caterpillar the size of a human arm. It enjoys sunbathing on the casters head and eating the casters clothing. The caterpillar will eventually enter an unnaturally hard cocoon in which it will undergo metamorphosis into an enormous butterfly. The butterfly will continue to follow the spellcaster if they propery cared for it before its metamorphosis, and can cast Giant Insects without concentration as a spell-like ability once per day.",
 "A small, seemingly conscious cloud of blueish smoke. Can distract and hinder enemies by hovering by their mouth and nostrils, but otherwise doesnt do much other than following its master.",

The figure is a pirate who escaped from an encounter with the authorities by abandoning their crew.

 "Off in the distance, a sunburned, unclean, lone figure on a lifeboat shoots off a flare, and desperately cries for help. The figure is the final survivor of a terrible shipwreck. This person is a simple fisherman. Should the party take the survivor aboard, they will refuse to go below deck, regardless of the circumstances. If asked, all they will say is “My friends were below deck.”",
 "Off in the distance, a sunburned, unclean, lone figure on a lifeboat shoots off a flare, and desperately cries for help. The figure is an arrogant cleric, surviving off of magically created food and water. This person is doing fairly well, all things considered. If rescued and delivered to their temple, this cleric will give the party a small favor, but will consider the party a small part in the cleric’s survival.",
 "Off in the distance, a sunburned, unclean, lone figure on a lifeboat shoots off a flare, and desperately cries for help.

$a_tale_from_an_old_adventurer=array("You fellas make sure to bring ink and parchment, you hear! I remember back, oh, 35 summers ago we found a crypt too big to tackle at the time so we decided to make a map. Only old Bark toes, well we called him Bark toes on account of being a druid his real name was Faelwyn (Sounds elvish but he was a Dwarf, damnedest thing really)... but anyway, old Bark toes had buried all our paper! Said it was only proper respect for Father Tree. So we had to hunt down a rabbit, tan the hide, then burn the map into it. Took 3 days, and that map reeked up my pack something fierce!",
 "Hah! That reminds me of a particularly harsh winter when a dwarf I traveled with thought it’d be fun to explore a cave despite us being low on rations. Needless to say by the time spring rolled around I was plus a few Bullywug bites and minus a short bearded friend!",
 "I wouldn’t eat that if I was you. I was once treated to the spectacle of what I thought was a Tabaxi coughing up a hairball. Turns out a Remorhaze egg had been incubating in her gut from some dodgy stew and she quickly became its first meal.",
 "You think this is bad weather? I’ve seen it rain so hard that you’d swear it was coming from the ground and the sky at the same time. My boots filled so fast I had to walk barefoot to the nearest shelter I could find. Nearly stepped on a gas spore.",
 "Well, let me tell you: you can take the mightiest knight or wizard in the kingdom, and theyll duel a demigod or storm the gates ohell. But you throw enough angry chickens atem, sooner or later theyll go DOWN. Buy me a top-shelf whiskey and Ill tell you how it happened to the high priest. It might come in handy later on.",
 "Thats a good story, but I bet you never saw a goliath hurl a gnome into the maw of an angry froghemoth, the hard part wasnt getting the gnome out of the creature, she did that much herself. The hard part was getting the stink o frog guts off of the gnome.",
 "Things are different these days, they are indeed. I was a Red Arrow, didja know that? Travelled all over these lands, usually in small bands but sometimes they were hundreds of us. Thousands! Everywhere we went wed work to make people proud of their own accomplishments. Make em happy, even if they said our arrows were orange! And if they stole from others, or said unkind things, why we stabbed them with our cold blue spears to let the people know how to behave like proper folk!",
 "This? Just a bit o mead from home. Like wine, but made of honey; theres a bit of rose in this one, I think. Want a taste? (If offer is accepted, the mead is described as being pleasantly sweet and smooth, if a bit dry. May cause heartburn for those with hearts.) Good stuff, innit? My uncles favorite; its basically all hed drink. Wed usually get that mead with the juniper berries mixed in, but my uncle preferred the rose mead. Said it tasted better. Dunno if I entirely agree, but thats what he would bring over. Heh...I remember one year, he came by, strangely empty-handed. My mum (his sister) asked where the mead was. Thats the thing, he said, they said they was out. Some damn fool had made off with the barrels, leaving none for the rest of us. He suffered through the juniper mead, but he sure as hell wasnt happy about it. But then comes next week, right? He comes by with two kegs of the stuff. THEY FOUND IT, he said. He said hed been walking along when he heard a commotion off the path, went to go check it out. And, sitting on top of a cart, drunk as hell, were the thieves. They hadnt even properly made off with the stuff, they were just sitting there barely off the road. Damn fools. My uncle seemed proud of himself. Man loved his mead. Maybe a little too much...",
 "Hah! Thats nothing! You want to know what up shit creek without a paddle really looks like? Lemme tell you a story: Me and four of me mates (or so I thought) were going through the mountains with a big load from... I wont tell, because I might actually get back to that pile o gold one day. But! We were going through this wicked cave, and suddenly drow, the dark bastards, jump out of the shadows and start shouting at us in broken common. Now, were alone in the mountains, one weeks travel from any civilization, and ambushed by a crew of drow. Thats the shit creek, now wheres me paddle gone? Well as if the situation wasnt bad enough, theres a cave in that separates me from me mates (got Spencers leg too), and now Im alone against a dozen pissed off drow. Now, how I got out of that situation with only a dirk and a shovel to my name, is a story that there isnt a cup of mead big enough to buy from me.",
 "So there I was, tied up. Not 20 feet from this sorceress and her gaggle of cultists. As the I was cutting my way through my bonds, and trying to signal to my mates that we need to stop this. The cultists were Chanting, the clouds were getting darker and the villager in the middle of the throng was getting really nervous. But all I could think about was that damn sorceress. Anyway, thats how I met my first ex-wife.",
 "That aint nothin to be scared of. You ever been chased by an undead thunder lizard, vomiting zombies? I tell yah, thatll change the color of your pants and maybe even your religion!",
 "So you should have seen it: Me, the most beautiful woman you ever saw and a table that turned out to be a mimic. Her palms were stuck to the surface for reasons I as gentleman shall not get into, and I was swinging my sword with one hand and hitching up my trousers with another. Anyway that was the last time I snuck into the Wizards college storage cellar to fool around.",
 "No crud, there I was at the Battle of Deepwater Isle, standing in front of the walls to Waterdeep. A hundred Sahaugin were storming up the bank, angry as a cat in a pond. We held them back, dropping them 3 to 1. Problem is, that wasnt fast enough and they just kept coming. Well, the Blackstaffs showed up on the wall behind us. Yah ever see what a Fireball does to aquatic flesh? It scared em, scared em right good but I tell yah, you never smell something so bad as burning water goblin! Except maybe troglodyte...",
 "Thats some nice shootin there. Did I ever tell you about the time I one-shotted an orc with my sling? See, we was jumped on the Trade Way, just a simple escort job. This little warband of orcs jumped us on the road, lookin for an easy take. Didnt expect we all had steel, yah see? We cut em down quick, but one slipped away, with a sack of valuables under his arm. That greenskin nicked an ox, no lie, tryin to ride it for all its worth. He was bouncing all around and not gettin too far. I picked up a rock off the ground, loaded my sling, one shot in the back of his head and he went tumblin; dead before he hit the ground.",
 "Thats a fine bit o gold there. Reminds me of the time I was prospecting for gold up north of Neverwinter. Mount Hotenow was still having its rumblings and we were pickin pieces that size out of the rivers!",
 "Oh dont complain about this little drizzle. Did I ever tell you about the time I was sailing back from Chult? Musta been only a couple years ago. We had 3 ships, full of old relics, when a bad squall kicked up. Swells were 30 to 40 feet and rain was crushing down on us in sheets. We barely stayed afloat, and whats worse; Everytime the lightning flashed, we saw tentacles rising up from the depths. Only 2 of our ships made it back... (Looks off distantly, glassy-eyed in memory)",
 "Now thats a fine bit o cloth. Almost reminds me of Owlbear fur. I tell yah, aint nothin better for keepin back the winter chill.",
 "I once wrestled 20 trolls with my bare hands! Yep, you should have seen those 15 hobgoblins, they were no match for me. Once they saw my muscles, those 10 kobolds ran for the hills!",
 "Youd be surprised how many times an adventurer met their end from overconfidence. I saw a man that cut a giant in two with a single slice die after insisting the river only looked deep.",
 "Never ask a paladin about how their oath works unless you want an hour long moral philosophy lecture complete with some shameless proselytizing.",
 "Took us nine days to find that phylactery. The lich was pretty pissed when we showed him it. That was the fourth time we killed that ancient relic disguised as a man but that was the first time any of us saw fear in an undeads eyes.",
 "Get bent, young-blood. You dont know nuthin bout no adventuring. I know so, cause if youd tell me a story bout what yuve seen and I passed my wine jug wiout noticin then Id cut my luvely beard! And I. Dunt. Cut. Muh. Beard. Or share teh wine... (Now the PCs have a chance to RP their characters telling a story of the experiences their character has had.)",
 "Say now, this reminds me of the time old Zollio rode a giant monitor lizard round the upside of a bridge to get a clear shot at the turtle dragon harassing us. Yessir, he was a sight to behold. Fell the whole way down and still managed to get the killing blow off that bow of his. I cant remember how we made it out of that one.",
 "So... you heard of the pale elf Drost Durden and his white tiger? He defied the laws of the over-light mountains, descended from their snowy peaks, and became a hero of the people. But thats just what the stories say, he is probably as cruel as the rest of them. (Note, there is a Dark Elf there listening to this story who looks very... very... very tired at listening to this)",
 "See this scar on my chin? The first deer I ever killed, I must have been 14, no 13. I waited for hours in a tree. Shivering in the cold, hungry as a dog. I pissed myself. Finally a young buck casually strolled up to my tree. I was so cold, I was scared my staccato breathing would scare him off. I raised my bow and my hands were shaking. Luckily it was directly under me. I couldnt miss. I let go and the arrow stuck him good in his side. It jumped up and buck a few times like a roaring bull. Then it hopped around in a a zig zag and almost seemed to lay down for a nap. I was young but I knew to wait a moment before approaching. I slowly climbed down the tree. I slipped the last couple feet. I sauntered over to the deer. I slowly kneeled down beside him. I took a moment to admire the steam coming off his body which some druids believe is the deers life essence leaving this plane. I leaned in close to his face and I thanked him for his meat which I was about to consume. The deer pulled its head back and butted me right in the face. His antler leaving a deep gouge in my chin. He jumped up took a couple steps and again collapsed under its own weight. At 13 years old, I provided for my family that cold night.",
 "When I was your age, we had no idea that there were any other planes. You were born on the prime material, and thats the way we liked it!",
 "When I was your age, we walked thousands of leagues to dungeons! Uphill both ways!",
 "Let me tell you something, young adventurer. Treat well youre boots for they protect you more than you know. That being said, I will never wear another pair again. I traded my boots for route sandals long ago, and let me tell you, I aint putting on another pair of boots! Id rather die! What do you mean Ive used the same phrase twice in one sentence?",
 "If you suspect that youre gonna run into gnolls, just piss yourself! Hyenae respect the scent of piss. Makes em feel like theyre messing with the property of someone powerful, ya know?",
 "Ive never been a fan of preparing spells. Back with the clergy of my youth, if you wanted a disease to be cured, THATS TOO BAD! YOU HAD TO DIE, JUST AS AMAUNATOR INTENDED!",
 "I never much cared for dwarfs. To stalky. Too hairy. What are gonna do with all that hair, hm? I dont trust it.",
 "Listen well. You need a danger word. I dont care about safe words or what you do with them. A danger word. Some things out there change their shapes. Mimic us. Hide the truth from your eyes. We had a rule. You found a way to work the danger word into conversation if your suspicions were up, but not your patience. Eaglepeak. That was ours. Weather here is nothing like Eaglepeak. or, The food here is worse than Eaglepeak.",
 "One day I wondered off from my caravan to relieve myself in private. Just my luck I was ambushed by bandits at the worst possible moment. Then for the first time in my life I was happy to hear the raspy scream of an owlbear. The bandits all ran in opposite directions, the owlbear had pecked on of them really good and was in the process of turning him into a pincushion with its pointy beak. I pulled my pants up, again at the worst possible moment, and I slowly turned around and walked away, once I got far enough to not hear the pecking of flesh I ran.",
 "There we were, trapped on the bridge between the Harpies and the 4-armed Pirate-Gorillas, when Smendrik the Adequate (as we called him then) got the bright idea to cast Featherfall and Burning Hands through a barrel while we all stood on top! How we got the barrel is another interesting tale, you see it four years prior to then that we came across...",
 "One time we met a Dwarf who bragged that he could disarm ANY trap. So we find something that looks suspicious and we let him prove himself. Hes sitting there for 10 minutes trying to disarm a weird little square of tile and a gout of flame shoots out of the wall next to him and sets his beard on fire! He runs around smacking himself trying to put himself out until our cleric finally extinguished him with a water spell. He stands there for a bit, beard half burnt off and drenched in water, looks at us and says just avoid that tile.",
 "One time, a long while ago, Trudy and I were trying to nab some merchant’s permit from a fancy party and Trudy got made. So, to sneak her out, I hid her underneath my ball gown. We were both lucky my corset was big enough. Of course, leaving so suddenly would have been suspicious, which is how I spent 3 hours walking around a party with my sister under my dress. Thankfully, no one offered me a dance.",
 "Never step through a portal. Not once, not ever. My party went through a portal that was supposed to be a shortcut into a wizards tower, right to the top. Promise of some quality wands in that tower, made us step through without thinking too hard on it. Five years later I came back to the Prime Material with no friends and no wands. I dont talk about those years. Just dont trust portals is all Im saying.",
 "I wont stand for slander against Warforged. They got souls and I wont hear no arguments about it. No talk of tinmen or automatons at my campfire. You take that backwards thinking to your little farm and hang up your sword, because you aint fit to be an adventurer. You fight with a forged at your back, or you listen to them talkin about the friends they lost in the first war, and you would know. They might be more human than you or me. Certainly more human than an elf. Dont get me started on those knife-ears.",
 "Never wake a sleeping Gnome. Im not kidding about this. Sure, you know not to wake a Barbarian, liable to get your arms chopped off, but Gnomes are worse. They can cast spells before theyre fully awake, see? Still half dreaming. You havent regretted a decision quite like getting polymorphed first thing in the morning.",
 "That flintlock you have there, may I see it? Ah, this reminds me of the rifle used by the infamous Tabaxi mage-slayer Odd Song Sung. I tracked that master assassin across this land, to-and-fro. Through battlefields and ruined cities older than you can fathom, yet she always stayed one step ahead. The last time I saw her, atop a tower above the street of Mordhau, eschewing her sights to read the charms she hung from the barrel of her weapon with fine chains as the winds of death shifted through them. I charged up those stone stairs faster than I have ever moved in all my days. But when I burst onto that damn platform there was nothing save for a single scrap of parchment held under a lose stone. Goodbye my friend it said in a curling script, it has been an honour fleeing you. I never saw that Tabaxi again.",
 "When youre in those swamps, never, I repeat, never follow the lights, Ive seen what happens, some might drown in the muck, others might get ambushed by lizardfolk, those are the lucky ones, the unlucky ones, they get torn to shreds the fog itself ripping them to shreds like a butcher, so fast they dont have time to scream...Ive seen things, are you sure you still want to go out there?",
 ".. and so there e was when Oi saw em, bold as a blacksmith strikin hot-steel, e struck that demon on the foreead wif is fryin pan! Oill neer outlive the day! Oi outlived em tho thas fer sure, poor bloke uz ripped in alf shortly thereafter, e wuz! But Ser Percivale e bought tha resta us poor blighters enough time for Brofver Caedsmuire to Banish em, and thas th reason Oi carry this foine fryin pan on me belt, see? Sides from bein imm-a-nent-ally prack-ti-cal, its one-a-them Me-minty.. Me-minnow.. Me-mento Mor-as and prack-ti-klee an oly relic!",
 "I used to be a blacksmith, but I got run out of town after a string of unlucky lasses had bairns which looked a mite too much like me. I ever tell you the time I had to shoe the Lord of the Nine Hells Mare? A Nightmare they calls em, and she twerent no mare, I tells yah... well, anyway she were a mite skittish, and so I took hold of her bridle and trotted her a bit, and I tell you each stride of hers was seven leagues, and dragged me along for the ride, and each time she would stop at the house of a lonely local lass and twouldnt budge a step afore I had made a call, then after that mare shed take another step (with me for the ride) to the next maids cottage, and on and on you see...",
 "My party would agree but I was the worst bard they ever had. Let me tell you a story to illustrate how bad I was. So here we were taking the time to refresh ourselves in the city when we find out that the town is using some weird magic to keep the place going, some type of sinister version of Druid magic. So there we were investigating when my party member ups and attacks one of the guards because they were in our way despite all of us agreeing to be discreet. So in a panic and also because I felt bad for the guy I casted healing word in hopes of maybe getting the guards off our back by being nice. Well I took out my flute and blew the flattest note my ears have ever heard and I saw that man cough up blood because regardless. If that situation wasn’t so crazy I would’ve laughed my head off that I actually hurt someone with healing word but hey you live and learn and I needed a lot to learn.",
 "Wanna know how I got these scars? Biggest dragon youve ever seen...probably the ugliest too. Anyways me and my mates were hacking him up when he took a wild swipe at me because I insulted his gecko mother. So there we were, me in his claws at least 500 feet in the air. I wrench myself free, climb up to his back and give him a good one two, ride his lifeless corpse all the way back to the hoard. We crash and I am launched noggin first into this beautiful baby Ive on my back right now. This greataxe cut me up nice that day, but all the best lovers do thats what I always say!",
 "You want to know where I got this sword huh? What if I told you I had to go the ninth hell and debate Asmodeus? Or the depths of pandemonium where I lost at least two friends and forgot one other? Mayhaps I got it from the githyanki pirates that killed my dog so I killed them all in return? Or maybe it was fashioned from the brain stem of the beholder that insulted my previous sword size? Perhaps I got it from the ancient vault of DrenDar the conquerer after we defeated his ancient blue dragon lover? Or perhaps I got it from Freaky Falzahads Magic Emporium down the street? Youll have to buy me two or three more ales to find out, friend.",
 "Trust me pal, the best part of adventuring is the food. You ever had dragon stew spiced with the ancient herbs found in a tomb and the marrow of a direboar? Ugh... Speaking of direboar...the tenderloin with a little high altitude mashed potatoes gardened by an centaur? You havent lived friend. Or granita (fruit ice) made by various fruits you had frozen during a fight with a white dragon? Refreshment for days. I could go on for years my friend, but I have another dish calling my name, until next time!",
 "I lost this hand fighting sirens a mile off the coast, oh... ten years back, I reckon. I keeps a leather pouch of the bones to remind me of my mortality; each drilled and filled with a mix of tin, lead, and a shaving from a single sterling piece, blessed by a priest of Saint Quimbles; and etched with the runes. Shalls I cast them and divine thy fate?",
 "Best not to deal with nobility who ask for discretion in carrying out their tasks. Better yet, best not to accept a blabbermouth into your ranks. Best not travel to the shadiest part of town and loudly announce your search of information on an assassination plot. Best not to blindly follow the kind old gentleman out of town, as he knows the assassins hideout. Best not to let your guard down and invite an ambush on your friends. Best not leave them to their deaths in desperation towards saving your own skin. Best not let your past force you into a life of running and hiding. Best not to deal with nobility who ask for discretion.",
 "There we were, about to be over-run by the damned, our backs against the fallen portcullis, when out of er satchel Sister Bloeddwyd Angelique pulled forth the candle prepared by the Holy-Matron and blessed by the Light. When she lit her taper, the candle shone forth a light fit to blind us! She placed the candle in the lock of the portcullis and a great flash and shout of a hundred wrathful angels blew us an opening! Id not be sitting here telling you the tale were it not for her!",
 "Never underestimate a Kobold, ye hear? Me brothers in arms wound up as food in thier cook fires, and Id be there too ifn I didnt high-tail it the moment I saw those first traps! Oh, aye, you call me a coward, but Ill neer go down any hole wherest Is spect them scaly buggers to be lurkin! Yous best be doin the same as I, and mind yourself! Mark me words!",
 "Aye, nowhere, no place in this world leaves you weary as the blasting fields. Scores of brave men and women have been swallowed by the harrowed place. For what? Glory. Ha. Riches. What vanity we had. The earth rumbles with every step you take. The smell burns your eyes and the air takes your senses. Me and my mates, brave as we once were, never feared it though. We should’ve. We should’ve feared the jets of fire that shot out like columns holding the sky above. But we didn’t. No. We marched, knowing the dangers. Knowing the risks. Knowing the rewards. Damn our arrogance. If we weren’t foolhardy enough to turn at the sight of that place, we certainly hadn’t the mind to beware the creatures that called the place home. That’s where I found out how true horror felt. How it seeps into your bones.",
 "I was a hired by a small band of naïve adventurers to guide them through the mountain passes in early winter. We should have turned back when the skies began to darken. But the gold... The storm hit hard and a thick, heavy blanket of snow covered every discernable landmark. The storm continued without end. I soon lost my way but, I kept that to myself. Because, the gold... Wolves took two of them in the dead of night, one froze to death after falling through the ice, and the last one? After six days in that frozen hell, I was the only one to walk out. But the gold...",
 "(While tuning a lute) Have I played The Mouse and the Magister for you yet? That used to be my specialty. Never failed to get the people clapping and the gold flowing. Now how did it go? La de da... mouse... Thats not it. When I played this for the Queen of Names she made me a knight on the spot. Thats a true story. You can call me Sir, please and thank you. La de da de da... mouse... Damn... Let me just play Sunrise Over Waterdeep for you again.",
 "Im telling you, first time I fought one it was called a Water Normal. That was many moons back now, you can believe that. Water Normals, used to pop out of wells in villages, just about every harvest, sure as the crops. Then a few decades go by and theyre not so regular, we start to hear them called Water Uncommons. Over hunted, see? Nowadays you almost never see them. You worry much when you get water from a well? Youre welcome. And so, yes, Water Weird, because they are now.",
 "Just sos you know, you can dance with the dead in the pale moonlight. It aint the dancin thats the problem, its the leavin after. Their grip is a might bit stronger than a clamp o iron. It probably wasnt worth the gold my pals bet me to do it. (He/she shows off a huge scar). You shouldve seen the other guy, though.",
 "We once convinced a kobold colony to mine out a block of stone in the ceiling of a dragons lair, dropping in on their head. Dragon problem done just like that, though, those damn kobolds did drive us out before we managed to take a share of the dragons hoard...",
 "I only loved one man: Bernar was his name, and what a fine man he was. He could swing an axe like a twig, and drank brandy like it was water. I had to leave him, however... I took a contract to hunt down a hag. Turns out my suspicions were right.. it was my mother in law!",
 "Now, I COULD spend the next turn of the hourglass telling you lies about the best way to wield a longsword; lies I learned guarding the Duke, and learned were lies when the Masked Menace cut the Dukes Demon-possessed head clean off; but since youre buying me a drink, tell me a bit of your travels?",
 "Throws his drink at the painting of a wealthy nobleman. Noble my rear end! Ive seen that man make love to a sheep after just 2 cups of mead. That ironbrained oaf still owes me 30 gold pieces too. I won it fair and square in a card game. He said he was good for it and I let him off the hook at the time but I shouldve taken his thumb as collateral and I woulda been justified to do it too. The healer I ran with at the time couldve put it back on 3 weeks later in just 10 minutes I tell ya.",
 "That sure is a nice weapon you have there, young adventurer. But its not about the size or value of the weapon, but the way that you use it. The older adventurer reaches for something strapped to their back and brings it into the younger adventurers vision This here is Pointy. My party and I were asleep in the forest one night, when I woke up surrounded by goblins and the sounds of screaming and crunching. No weapons, no armor, and my fellow adventurers were already as good as dead. The only thing nearby was this one strong, arm-span long, and unusually pointy stick. It must have been sent by divine beings that cast pity on me because it seemed to shine as I quickly reached for it. I picked it up, and I just started jabbing it at every goblin that came near me. Quick thrusts. I aimed for the eyes. I was there all night, and, just as I was about to collapse from exhaustion, the sun started to rise, and the goblins, many of whom were missing at least one eye each at this point, retreated. Ever since then, I have always kept Pointy with me to remind me that the most humble of tools can have the greatest of effects, to remind me of my lost comrades, and, well, in case of goblins.",
 "Speaking of alcohol, if you ever go to the Pinepoint Inn down the street NEVER drink more than one pint of their Hunters Meade. I know it may be delicious, but I did it a couple of years ago and I woke up in a cave surrounded by a group of Kobolds who apparently started worshiping me as their new regent. Took me three weeks to get out of there! I can hold my liquor, but Im never drinking Hunters Meade again.",
 "The Icy Wastes are cold, cold, cold I tells ya! Only madmen and the darkest of evil travels there! I lost a hand and a leg to the cold, after I followed the Lost Prince and the Crusade to find the Egg! We found the Egg alright; it was beautiful, like a singular jewel, just sitting there on the altar of the Icy Temple, glittering for all to see! Then the men began to scream and freeze into place! I ran away, dragging my frozen limbs, of fifty men that went in, only three returned, and the Prince was not one of them!",
 "A cloaked and masked lady once hired us to take her deep into the woods, then bade us keep our distance while she spent the night alone atop a hill crowned with a ring of faerie stones. She never told us her name and commanded us never to speak of it. But do you remember the festivities when old Queen Gennereth turned out not to be barren after all? And isnt her daughter a rare beauty, like something youve never seen? Makes you think.",
 "Before you use your spell casting powers to win the affections of a fair woman or gallant gentleman remember the tale of the wizard Geniinewab. When Geniiwewab heard that the fair maiden Alessandras beloved crow was ill he trapped all the town clerics in a forcecage so that Alessandra would be forced to consult him instead. In an effort to demonstrate his magnificent power Geniinewab killed Alessandras crow with finger of death and then used a wish spell to revive it. The night after casting that wish spell Geniinewab caught the flu. Since the great wizard was enfeebled by the wish spell and all the town healers were locked up Geniinewab died within a week.",
 "Now, dont believe a word they say bout the moon being made of green cheese. I should know, I was there, me and my mates, you see, we sailed there one night when we were lost in a thick fog off the coast of Nuperie... Just remember when sailing, if you see a big fog bank roll in under a moonlit sky.. you should turn the ship right around and Nuperie right out of there! Ha Ha Ha!",
 "My faithful hounds!, theys call us, their Majesties would! Why.. hold on, my neck itches.. would you scratch it? These old arms cant quite reach behind.. ahh! Oh yiss, thats divine.. that thumping noise? Oh.. sorry.. my leg does that when I get scratched there.. well anyway, they used their baleful magics to turn us into the very hounds they imagined us as, the party and I, you see.. we spent a good six years in that state, hunting the nine-tailed fox spirits! Howd we change back? Well their Majesties got offed by a party of adventurers, and wouldnt you know it, we changed right back to ourselves... Petersen though still had that awful case of magical fleas!",
 "Now now.. wheres my pen and paper? I must certainly write down an account of your travels, they seem comparable or even to eclipse my own, most remarkable tales... most remarkable! Why, I too, recall coming up against savages, and thought my solution to be quite ingenious, you see, my party and I would replace the gemstone eyes of their idolatrous god with costume jewelry INDISTINGUISHABLE to the real thing... unfortunately, someone had already beaten us to the punch! The gems were fake the whole time! Oh, you should have seen Lord Perfidys apoplectic face! He kept that face for the few moments of his life he had remaining after taking that savages spear to the guts! Which, I daresay, still haunts me whenever I close my eyes for more than a moment...",

Be good now, Children! So long! Byeee! Now, mates, where was I? Oh yes, the story of how I lost my right eye! Its a sordid tale involving the most beautiful ghost lady-captain I ever did see! Our love was one for the ages! I had my eye removed and magically enchanted to only ever see her, I did! And that was how I came to lose my Left Hand! You see it was shortly after...",
 "... and THAT, my friends, is why you dont go sticking ANY part of your AN-AT-OH-MEE anywhere near a mimic what looks like a KEE-YOOT little innocent stuff-ed an-ee-myool, no siree! Why that poor himbo over there lost more than one peice of his elf to that mistake! What? He looks fine to you? Why that boy is devastated! Devastated!",
 "Now, Im usually pretty good with the ladies, no lie, but I tell you when I, in a drunken stupor, asked the Goddess Ishtar for a kiss, and got one! Why, I was over the moon! That night we made sweet, passionate love... you should have seen it! raunchy humping motions... but.. I feel I can trust you with this, the next morning, there was a donkey in my bed!! I never did see where Ishtar went, and now mere mortals just arent the same. Ever since then Ive decided to limit myself to just ten, ten drinks.. maybe twenty a night, sos the next time I see that Goddess, I wont pass out and get to see her afore she leaves...",
 "And on tha twelfth night, it as exactly as dark as on the leventh, but then BAM! suddenly tha brightest light I never did seen came shinin outta that tower and ALL the demons of Hell acame ariding out of it, it near sounded like.. the light made that much noise, jennle-men, I guarantee.",
 "When we moved to break into the block wall bricking up the secret passage, we found the body of someone who died trying to escape. Their fingers were worn to stumps and the back of the blocks were bloody. Never did find out what scared em so.",
 "All Im sayin is a good adventurer needs a good pair of gloves. Too many potion sellers dont wash their hands, and who knows what kind of poison is gonna get under your nails? And besides, if you hold your weapon without a pair, your palms will get all calloused. Mine are smooth as a babys bottom, wanna feel?",
 "If youre ever in the deep forest, and come across a clearing youve not seen afore, empty save for a ring of mushrooms, turn around, and walk away. It aint worth your troubles, believe me. You know how hard it is to escape the Fae? Damned bastards took me for everything I had, and Im lucky at that. And this damned mark on my hand never did fade, either.",
 "I remember once back in my mercenary days, we were besieging this walled city... on a hill... on a peninsula. Perfect defensive position, right? Our employer was smart enough to know that a normal assault would have been suicide. So we just blasted the place with explosive spells. Days and days of hurling fire and lightning at those walls while trying not to get shot by their archers... I can still hear the booming in my ears sometimes. Eventually we brought a wall down and stormed the city. Damned messy business.",
 "It was the third month of the Long Cloud, by our reckoning. I was out hunting when I saw some shady looking folk around what looked like an altar. I laid there for a little, listening to them chant gibberish, but I knew I couldnt take em all in a fight. Left a few traps for the bastards, though. Never found out if they were behind the whole thing.",
 "Lemme tell you something kid, wizards are all fine and dandy... as long as they stick to the normal spells. But you ever meet a wizard who goes on about experimenting, and new forms of magic... you get out of there. Nine times out of ten that whole thing will end in a big explosion.",
 "These ales are practically water! A true mans drink can only be found in the Crested City. They use their crystals, ya see, and grind em up and put em in the drinks. Stronger and better than any other! I need to get back there some day.",
 "Aliases are healthy, kid! You give a false name when dealing with anyone that might want you harmed. Not to mention fairies and the like. Ive got a dozen or so names you might find around the country! Of course this isnt my real one either. You really think my parents named me Mortimer?",
 "I don’t take drinks or food from people I don’t know. Got me in trouble quite a few times in my youth. I thought myself as quite charming, and tried making conversation with a Hag my party and me were having dealings with. Asked about the pot of soup she had cooking behind her, and instead of an answer I got a bowl full of the stuff. Well, I couldn’t just back down from a challenge, could I? It tasted alright, and the she told me about the slaad eggs she had planted in it. Told me I had three months before it would erupt and kill me, unless we went and got the scales of a black dragon for her. Lucky for me, I could think on my feet, and so I stuck my fingers down my throat and puked the monstrosity out onto her! Oh, she was raging mad, and my party was about ready to kill me after we fought her. But it all worked out alright, didn’t it?",
 "When the King did call for brave venturers explorin the frontiers, I did answer the call. When the King did demand wen all lay down our lives and clear these lands in is name, I did, and my wife and children too! And, when it were them what lost that life an I forced to remain these 15 years past, what does the King and Crown do when dark-forces do gather and threaten all we have done? Does e go reward our service? Does the Crown protect? Nay! The Crown abandons us! Mayhaps we should abandon the Crown...",
 "Fire, I says; tis your best friend an tworst enemy tat the same time! Sees this scar pon me face? Flask of oil xlpoded afore I could throw er when the party and I faced off against that dark wizard Wosszname? Frank!? Frank me boy, what was that wizards name? The one where I got this scar strangling the life out of with these two hands!? Oh, Franks asleep I see. Too boring for you, eh Frank!??!",
 "When Ser Porthe fell in battle off the far shores of Guthay, we saw fit to preserve the body from putrefaction by storing it in a cask of fine Canary that had previously been Sers favorite. Seeing as not to waste any, as they likely took up quite a bit of the barrel, we shared a goodly portion with the fellow crew, before sealing. Now, I dare say, I scarcely can take a glass without remembering and mourning the fact that we still lack the golds required for their resurrection... Lets Toast to Good Ser Porthe! Ser Porthe!",
 "I came here to drink and forget the heaps of trouble my spouse lays upon me on a daily basis. Oh fer certain, I marched with the Lord against that vile Hag and their coven, but no matter how far we marched we could never catch em. Each night we lost a soldier or more, when they ran from the camp screaming of night terrors, we usually found their bodies in the morning... tell you the truth, Id rather be there than back home with the fractious family, some days...",
 "Loudest ting I never did ear, I confess, wuz tha splosion of tha Powder Stores on tha Good Ship Lawbringer. Oh she brought tha law that day, I was on er, and she brought tha Law of Unintended Consequences! Shattered tha port, and collapsed tha channel, she did, and collapsed tha sea wall too! Lost us tha battle, and tha city when they gained entrance via tha hole. I managed ta survive, but I lost my hearing and was imprisoned and then enslaved for six years! Was a miracle and a steep one I paid for, when a travelling cleric healed me, and took me from that place...",
 "You kiss the toe yet? Sposed to be a ritual, you know. A warnin against those who dont pay their tab. I got a deal I did! Thats my toe, I paid my tab with it! You wouldnt mind buyin me a drink now, would ya?",
 "I tells ya, I saw FOUR, FOUR! masked Tortles down in those sewers! Meanest I ever came across. Scuffled with em once on a run for the society, see.. they kept shouting if I wanted a piece-a-them, well.. when I saws they were all armed, and with that tough shell.. well, I turned tail and ran. Now, dont go thinking me a coward now, when I found out they took down that Grell, that golem, and those masked warrior monks that worshipped it? Well.. seems I made the smart choice, friend-o; the smart choice!",
 "Yall ever heard of the snail that wouldnt die? Once we were delving in a deep forgotten dungeon, looking fo loot and other bits. Well we found some, a great big chest that was lockd like sumfin tough. Well our sneakthief opend it and there werent nothing but single snail, still living but it didnt have no food in there. Little thing started to crawl out towards the north, ignoring everythin we did to it. Scared me silly, still never did get us no loot from that place.",
 "... so trapped as we were and with days before help would arrive, we did what we had to to survive. Im not proud of want we did, but I challenge any decent creature in the same position to do different. Anyways, Ill tell you something for nothing. Kobold doesnt taste anything like chicken.",
 "Once knew human. Skinny little thing she was. Ranger. Good with a bow. Obsessed with herself. Beauty treatments, strange potions. You name it, shed try it. Got herself hold of some paste with flail snail muck in it. Rubbed it all over her skin. The next morning, she started glowing all different colours. Real bright like. Never laughed so hard in my life. Like watchin a magic show. Took us weeks and weeks to find a wizard to reverse the effects. Sometimes, when she hiccuped, shed still let out a little burst of colour.",
 "All nobles are bastards, right? Only some are bigger bastards than others. Myself and a group of, um, compatriots got ourselves hired by a bunch of farmers to defend a town and a handful of villages from some hobgoblin raiders. Couple days in, we mange to capture one alive. Turns out the local baron was the one that hired them. He wanted to raise taxes and was using the raids as an excuse. Anyway, long story short, the baron ended up on the wrong end of a hobgoblin sword and the lads ended up being very well paid.",
 "Take my advice son, steer clear of fey. Dont mess with the little ones and steer clear of the big ones. Dont talk to them, dont even look at them if you can avoid it. Carry some cold iron on you, just in case. And especially, dont bargain with them. No good can come of it. Theres a reason they call me Tails and it aint because Im a good story teller.",
 "My arm? Did I lose my arm in the war? Well, let me put it this way young person. The next time a wizard tells you to keep your arms at your sides during a teleport spell, you do it!",
 "(Hoarse voice) Harum... I havent cough... havent seen much of folk in the past year, bit out of practice talking. But been out on my own since I uh... lost my adventuring partners to a wolf attack. (scratches their neck, a bite scar is visible on it) Biggest wolf I ever seen, tore through four of us like we was thin cloth stretched over bales of hay. Bowled me over onto a rock, hit my head and was out for I dont know how long. (clears throat and it sounds like a low growl) Came to and that beast was gnawing on what was left of my buddies, muzzle soaked in blood. I mustve made a noise because it suddenly looked at me, eyes ablaze... (glances nervously at the moon breaking through the clouds) That was the unluckiest and luckiest time of my life. It jumped me, slowed down I guess from being gorged on my friends. Got its jaws locked on my throat but I got a hand up in time, saved me from getting killed instantly. (holds out a hand with deep, ragged scars all along it, highlighted in the glow of the campfire) Figured I was done for but my other hand happened to fall on what remained of our priestly fella. Whatever god he worshiped mustve put his dagger right where Id grab it. I just stabbed blindly. Maybe hit something important cause the creature leapt away like it was seared with a hot poker. (pulls out a fancy dagger, more ceremonial than practical, its silvery blade shining. The speakers voice grows more hoarse, a barking cough escaping their lips) Kept it with me ever since... just... in... caaaaasse.... (And the moon breaks from the clouds entirely, bathing the campfire circle in its pale glow as the speaker bends double with a howl of pain as their limbs start to contort...)",
 "I got lost in a good book, once. Took me pages and pages to find my way out, and you ask me where my fingers on my left hand went? Paper cuts, I tell yah! Damn thing up and swallowed me whole while reading! Was my favorite book too...",
 "Strange lad? You want to hear something strange? Well, I adventured with this mage for a couple of years. He was a bit ... odd. Kept to himself mostly, very private and shy. Insisted on separate sleeping quarters. Mumbled a lot. We all figured, yknow, magic user. Weirdness. Paranoia. Odd behaviour. Strange smells. It comes with the territory. Too much mercury and bat shit in spell components. Anyway, we get hired by this prince to get rid of a gauth and when we tracked it down, the thing just laughed and laughed at us. Then gulp, it ate our mage, all in one go. Then, it spat out three Batiri goblins. One. Two. Three. Whole and intact. Damnedest thing I ever saw. When the gauth stopped laughing, he thanked us for the meal and entertainment and said hed be moving on. Turns out, the little buggers had found some kind of enchanted cloak and had been sitting on each others shoulders. Had us proper fooled.",
 "Fundamental rule of adventuring my friend: always, always, always make sure your potions havent expired. Knew this elf that left a potion of animal friendship in his backpack for a wee bit too long. We were trying to get past some wolves at the mouth of a cave, and he remembered this potion. Well the wolves became friendly. A little too friendly if you get my drift. That poor elf, he had creatures coming at him from all directions. Spent the next few hours running around trying to avoid the attention of bears and bats and birds. Let that be a lesson to you all: test before you taste");

 "Along this trail someone has gathered up sticks and twigs from the ground. Then, they wove the sticks together to make eight egg-shaped arches placed right over the path. The arches are about 7 feet tall, and can easily be passed through.",
 "The path rounds a hill and overlook a huge field, in the field a stepped tower ruin made of stone juts up. The tower is weathered and crumbling, and nothing can be found inside, but the sight is impressive.",
 "The path leads up through a grassy steppe and up through a steep hillside. The path gives way to stone stairs. Someone has come through and taken surplus stone slabs of the same material as the staircase and placed them vertically or at odd angles to decorate the trail.",
 "A small marble rotunda has been built at the edge of a river. It seats three comfortably but offers no shelter as the roof is made of latticed iron. At the center of the rotunda is a small statue of a cat holding a fish in its mouth proudly.",
 "The path crosses another, but does not directly connect as it goes under a large bridge. On the underside of the bridge someone has taken differently colored river stones and attached them to the ceiling to look like a clear night sky. Several well known constellations can be seen in their work.",
 "The path is unpaved, and generally unkempt, but you happen upon a short wide staircase, regal enough for any king. The staircase is 10 steps tall and wide enough for 5. It boasts a wide stone banister carved of marble. Carvings of plants and forest creatures decorate the sides. Someone has come through and pried all the gems from their eyes and the gold plating from the staircase in general, but the impressive stonework remains. The staircase connects to a higher portion of the path, which continues on as normal.",
 "The path begins to steepen, with roughly formed stairs leading the way. The trail takes a sharp hairpin bend to proceed. At the inner bend of their hairpin is a carefully carved statue of a woman, holding a fox in her arms. Several candles have been lit and placed all over the statue.",
 "A roughly hewn ladder leads up into a whirl of sticks sitting atop a thicket. It looks almost like a massive birds nest. The inside can not be seen until you climb the ladder. Inside is a sheltered padded bed that will fit two comfortably.",
 "The path passes directly through a huge tree. A set of stairs have been formed from the tree roots leading up to an open archway of bark that bisects the tree. Inside the archway many passers by have left behind graffiti.",
 "Three skinny trees have been carefully grown along the side of the path. They split from a common root and widen out to support a stone table top about 5 across. Then they grow back inward, making a triple arch over the table, before recombining at the apex and finally leafing out in a natural tree formation. The table is clear.",
 "The fencing along the side of this trail is made up of live trees, grown in such a way that they weave their trunks together. At the top of these fences the trees sprout with bright green leaves. Beyond the fence, open prairie.",
 "The path becomes grassy and well maintained, and the trees become neatly trimmed. After a mile or so of this pristine artful forest the trees give way to an open clearing with a single wooden gazebo at the center, covered in flowers in full bloom. Benches all around the gazebo have been placed to support a large audience.",
 "The path leads along a rocky creek, flowing with crisp water. After half a mile the source of the creek is found, flowing from the palm of a massive hand carved of stone. The Hand gently tips the water on top of a single juvenile tree. The stones all around the hand and water are thick with mosses.",
 "A tree along the side of the path has been grown into an unnatural pattern. The trunk has split into several branches, the outermost forming a diamond shape, and the inner ones forming holes around on another in a sort of weaving pattern. The branches all recombine to form the trunk after the diamond pattern and the rest of the tree appears to be normal.",
 "The path curves around the base of a massive white wisteria tree, with dark black winding branches and brilliant streams of white flowers. Petals are gently raining all along the trail.",
 "The path gives way to a long line of wooden discs carved from tree trunks, lined end to end for at least a mile of trail.",
 "Someone has hung a pentagram made of sticks from a tree overhanging the path, and tied each point in the star with a different bundle of drying herbs.",
 "The trail curves past a waterfall before cutting up through a stone cliff. Right before the staircase begins the stone landing has been carved into a beautiful viewing point for the falls, with dwarven cut banisters.",
 "The next section of path is clearly marked, and yet anyone approaching it has the strong urge to avoid the path, feeling a mix of wonder at the forest and annoyance at the path. There is no spell forcing anyone off the trail, merely a suggestion. A plaque laid out off the trail on either side reads The road less traveled Kevyn Picot. Multimedia; Forest, enchantment.",
 "The path approaches a pond. The pond is perfectly square around the outside, and the path moves over the pond, on a series of rough laid stones covered in mosses, in a curved pattern. Branching off the path at regular intervals are tight spirals of stone. The pond is smooth and several Koi fish can be seen swimming in the clear water.",
 "As you approach this section of trail a shimmering humanoid can be seen standing by a tree, smiling politely. When you are close enough the human figure - a young man wearing a well tailored three piece suit - offers a tour. If you take the tour, he will tell about a historical battle fought in this very forest hundreds of years ago when the land was contested between elves and a clan of centaur. If you decline, the humanoid wishes you well and goes back to smiling politely.",
 "It has rained recently, the ground is wet and muddy. As you continue on you come upon a deck of cards that has been scattered through the forest, some cards in the trail, some in trees, some half buried, but all of them are clean and pristine. If the party manages to gather all the cards, they immediately re-scatter from the holders hand, all over the forest once again.",
 "A single tree in the forest, a few yards off from the trail, shimmers with refracted light. On closer inspection the whole tree appears to have been carved from a massive deep blue tourmaline.",
 "Someone has put down mile markers along the trail, big slabs of local stone with carefully carved dwarven numbers. They are not evenly spaced though, and dont seem to accurately reflect distance at all.",
 "A fox is resting on top of a sunny rock. The trail splits in two to go around the rock and then recombines on the other side.",
 "The trail has begun to run alongside a low, calm creek with flat stones at the bottom. The water is only about calf-high. Walking in the water is soothing and invigorating. However every so often the creek bed is marred with deep (20+ yard) stone holes, perfectly circular.",
 "The forest which was wild at the start of your journey, has been cleared of all trees except for birch [willow, maple, whatever], and there are no leaves on the ground . You dont see any stumps. Nature check (10 or better) and you see that many patches of the earth have been filled in with fresh soil. Careful observation reveals that this patch of the forest trail deviates slightly from your map, but recombines with the expected trail when the birch forest ends.",
 "Someone has hung lanterns through this stretch of the forest trail. At night they light up with colorful elemental light. Every so often, you think you can see a lantern far off in the forest, away from the trail. Probably a trick of your eyes.",
 "At the top of a massive sequoia tree you can clearly see a single window, lit from the inside. After looking for a while, the light goes out and the window disappears.",
 "Someone has placed massive glowing spheres in the trees nearby, which have begun to grow over the spheres with time. The spheres glow a yellow orange and range from one foot to 4 feet in diameter. Some are high up in drooping branches, some tucked into the roots of trees.",
 "In the forest something vaguely humanoid catches your eye, just for a moment. It is deep in the brush but, moving your head slightly, you can just barely make the outline of a person. If the party inspects further they will find a human sized sculpture made entirely of a mirrored surface, to reflect the forest around them.",
 "Broken pottery scatters the ground. Pieces of broken flower pots lay all around the roots of the trees here, giving the sense that these trees burst out of their former containers rather quickly.",
 "Someone has knit a long winding strip of colorful yarn to cover the path for the next 10 yards. The yarn seems stain resistant and resilient, as the colors have held true for who knows how long. Walking on it is very soft and pleasant.",
 "Someone has come through this section of forest and dug the soil away from the trail to form a sort of top-down view of a home. The pit is about 6 feet down, and contains furnishings and walls formed from the soil, avoiding tree roots where it can. The house meanders along the path and is not traditionally square or regular. The path is untouched, but bisects this house of sorts.",
 "Though the area here is wild, someone has planted a row of rosebushes along this section of trail, the roses are in full, brilliant bloom.",
 "A statue of an angel with a large stone sword stands to the right of the trail. Several small pouches have been laid at its feet.",
 "You can hear faint voices up ahead. As you approach, you seem to have stumbled into a painting class. Students at a wide range of ages are scattered throughout the field with easels, painting the landscape. A teacher, and old woman, walks between them offering critique and guiding her students.",
 "The trees overhead have had translucent fabric hung from their branches, just barely reaching the trail. It is easy to push the fabric aside to continue. As the trail progresses the fabric changes from white to pink and on through a rainbow of colors.",
 "The trees along this stretch of pathway have had a myriad of wedding dresses fitted to their trunks. Some of the dresses are older, rotting away with mosses and torn by the growing trunk. Some are recent and pristine.",
 "A hundred or so Wands have been stuck point first into the soil at the edge of the trail, making a small field of sticks. Each wand appears to be different in style, and some appear to be affecting the surrounding plant life with their presence.",
 "The trail slopes downward into a field of mostly boulders. All throughout someone has lit incense atop the rocks, creating a strongly perfumed smoky fog along the trail.",
 "A large red clay pot has been placed on its side at the top of a nearby creek falls. The back of the pot has been removed to let water flow in, changing the waterfalls course to flow out of the mouth of the pot, giving the effect of constant pouring.",
 "Woven spheres of sticks have been placed over sprouting plants along the trail. It appears the intent was to encourage planted vines and bushes to grow into the sphere pattern, but the plants have only just recently begun to grow.",
 "A huge tree grows at the bend in the trail, apparently healthy. However a full 2 feet of trunk has been removed, leaving the top of the tree hovering, fully unsupported. In place of the missing trunk, a crystal pendulum is attached to the top part of the tree, hanging down in the center of the would-be trunk. A detailed glyph has been burned into the bottom stump depicting an 8 pointed star with axis for Yes, No, Trusted and Deceiver. As people walk by the pendulum moves to point to different areas of the glyph.",
 "A tree ahead is blooming out of season. Upon closer inspection at the base of each blossom a silver ring fits snugly. Removing the ring causes the blossom to wither and die.",
 "Ahead the mountain trail gives way down a steep cliff with a descending staircase. Along the way, several man-made turquoise pools of water cascade down into one another from a local spring. The pools each feed into one another and have a submerged bench to seat between 5 and 10. No other people can be seen.",
 "You began noticing a few spider webs catching morning dew as you continue. The webbing becomes more and more common and as it does, the strands shimmer with iridescent color. After a while thick and heavy opal strands drape over the trail like blankets. Eventually the webbing fades like it appeared, and the trail is clear again. For the rest of the day, your party is unperturbed by insects.",
 "The trail passes by a clearing with a circle of wagons at the center. The wagons appear to be overgrown and rotting. On closer inspection there are a group of statues of merchants in poses of laughter, trade, or rest. All of them appear happy. Many of the wagons contain small offerings, perhaps left by passing merchants?",
 "Ahead you can clearly see snow falling, regardless of season. The trail passes through the center of a miniature town sculpted from toothpicks. The town is massively detailed, with the tallest 4 story buildings only raising to chest height. Tiny lights have been enchanted in the lamp posts and houses. Snow gently falls here, landing in the soil, but never accumulates more than an inch.",
 "The forest ahead is filled with birdhouses of various shapes and styles. Birdseed has been scattered, and birdfeeders hang off from the trail. The whole forest is alive with bird calls.",
 "You happen across a long bridge spanning a chasm. Glancing to the northeast you see another bridge, made of a fallen tree and much more wild than this one. A procession of elk, deer, wolves and smaller creatures are crossing the bridge calmly together. When they reach the other side you can no longer see them.",
 "You hear the sound of distant creaking. Perception check to spot, deep in the forest, a structure. Far off the trail is an overgrown sailing ship, sails unfurled and billowing. There is a large hole in the hull. Trees and mosses have overtaken the ship.",
 "The trail opens to a cliffs edge, overlooking the village ahead, rolling patches of farmland quilt the land below. A tall church tower rises up from between the wooden homes. A gust of wind pulls across the land, making a ridge of bowed plants and curling the smoke from the chimneys.",
 "A pair of gigantic antlers are arched over the trail, over the partys heads with room to spare. Glistening strings with blown glass stars have been hung from various points on the antlers.",
 "The trail peters out over an open field, several groups of locals are scattered in the grasses on blankets, eating and laughing. The groups appear to be friends and families, with many children running and playing. Tonight the Northern Lights are expected to make a great showing, according to the local wizard, and people are already arriving to get good seats.",
 "The trail passes by half a stone face carved from a boulder, Just this half of the face is taller than any party member. A mile down the trail, the other half of the face. Farther still, a hand holding a sword hilt and the broken fragments of sword. Then another hand holding onto a lantern the size of a small house, lit by some magical force. The plant life around this lantern has withered to dust. At the center of the next village is a massive stone platform.",
 "Paint marks on the trees of this forest come together from one specific viewing angle to form the portrait of an elf, from all other angles the paint simply looks like a chaotic mess.",
 "The trail passes by a circular mirror which is being held from behind by a statue. The Statue depicts a man in a cloak with an impossibly long neck and the face of a barn owl, peering over the top of the mirror and gazing at itself.",
 "Along the trail are spheres of iron, hollow on the inside about 2 feet in diameter. The iron shell has been cut out to show a forest scene made in metal, each sphere has a different scene. Someone has set a campfire inside each. The fire on the inside of the sculpture backlights the iron cutouts, and lights the trail.",
 "Someone has placed dress forms along the trail. Over time the forest has re-claimed the dress forms. Mosses drape over some, vines crawl up others, flowers have bloomed around the base of one, making a very impressive neckline. Each mannequin seems to have grown a beautiful dress or suit.",
 "Several tree trunks have been stripped of all branches and bark. Faces and animal forms have been carved into the remaining wood, still rooted to the ground.",
 "In the lush green forest a massive circle of obsidian, about 20 feet across, has been placed just off the trail. It is elevated off the ground about 2 feet, held up by wrought iron legs. A recent rainfall has filled the slightly concave surface with perfectly smooth reflective water. After looking for a moment, a drop of water falls from a tree, disturbing the smooth surface.",
 "Rather than building a bridge over the top of this stream, someone has tunneled underneath. Inside the tunnel is lit by a cluster of luminescent moths.",
 "The forest seems to be recovering from a fire, perhaps one or two years prior. In the wake of the fire someone has come through with colorful translucent resin, pouring it in the cracks of half burned trees and logs and reshaping the portions that has been burned. With the returning overgrowth the forest appears bright and surreal.",
 "Several animal skulls are piled to the right of the trail. Each one has been delicately carved with an intricate pattern, without losing the structural integrity of the skulls.",
 "At a bend in the trail, just off to the right, someone has placed a perfectly smooth cylinder of white marble, 7 feet tall. Walking around to the back of the cylinder reveals a highly detailed face has been carved into a deep crack in the marble.",
 "On either side of the trail Two massive stone wings have been placed, reaching toward the sky.",
 "A massive illusionary koi fish swims through the forest trees along the trail. Every so often dipping down to pass right through the party. Each time it does, the air smells of fresh mint.",
 "Someone has taken the heads of old broken shovels and attached them at the base to make a huge metal pine cone. Then they placed it on this trail, for some reason.",
 "At first you think perhaps someone has spilled a bag of coins, but you realize that the scattered coins get more and more dense, almost like a mosaic. For about 10 yards the trail is perfectly paved with coins before the trail peters out again. The coins here appear to be from all different regions, in small denominations. Should you leave some coins to further the trail too?",
 "The trail here has been draped with mosquito netting. In addition to freeing you from the pestering of insects, you also have a chance to see several beautiful moths and butterflies up close from the other side of the net, they dont seem to notice you while you are in the netting.",
 "A stray dog wanders up to you on the trail and decides to walk with you. He has a red bandanna tied around his neck. After about a mile or so he wanders off again.",
 "Passing by a wide stream you spy a stray cat walking into the water. To your shock the water arcs around the cat, keeping it perfectly dry. With a deft swipe the cat snatches a fish from the water wall in front of it, and leaves the stream, still dry, now fed.",
 "The trail has become a stone hopscotch board.",
 "You come upon a small decorated sign that reads the masquerade trail - Speak aloud your costume The sign can not be passed without speaking a request. For the next 6 miles of trail an illusion of the requested costume surrounds you. Along the trail several other costumed travelers pass.",
 "A sculpture of a giant metal key leans against an old tree. It is labeled Important.",
 "The trail bisects a white wall, 6 feet high. The wall moves from north to south in a straight line, with no end in sight. Passing through the wall the interior side shows two different scenes, in motion. On the wall running north; a snowy village with several children having a snowball fight. On the wall running south; A bustling city in the midst of a festival. The wall is made of calcite, a Rock that refracts light and images.",
 "The path opens up into a field where several gigantic metal rings support celestial sculptures. The Sun and Moon are represented by colorful and bright spheres carved into the faces of two women. Other planets and important stars have their own rings. It appears that the rings move in time with the celestial bodies, accurately depicting their position from the perspective of someone at the center of the sculpture.",
 "The forest has changed to become meticulously kept, more like a garden than the wilderness. At the base of each forest tree for the next mile is a small table with a bonsai tree, a perfect miniature of the tree it has been placed under. After a mile you come across an elderly man who is tending toa bonsai, not yet quite perfectly matching it respective tree. The Man invites you for a meal and a blessing from the forest");
$artifacts_of_great_power=array("Orb of Planar Melding: This orb allows the user to overlap planes of existence through a complex ritual. Whether razing cities by combining it with the plane of fire, or using it to open up the world to an army of demons and undead, the scale provides dangerous power. Destroyed by: utilizing the orb to combine opposites such as the Positive and Negative Energy planes, or Feywild and Shadow Planes together, the artifact will implode taking a radius of 200 ft with it.",
 "Ark of Famine: At first glance, this wooden box appears much like a child’s coffin – a long wooden box, completely unadorned, full of sand and designed to be carried by two pallbearers using handles over the shoulders. However, the Ark houses the collective spirits of those killed by hunger and crop blights long ago. Drawing on these spirits, the Ark consumes any and all crop or plant matter in a maddened hunt for nourishment. Destroyed by: Wherever it goes, any plant matter or food within 300 feet is destroyed and cannot be recovered. Prying the Ark open and filling it with water will destroy it.",
 "Heart of Magic: The still beating heart of one of the most powerful sorcerers who ever lived. The magic in their blood still powers the heart. The heart can be used as a spellcasting focus, and when used as such, all spells made with the heart count as two levels above the level of the spellslot used. Flaw- the heart is still unstable, and all physical damage done directly to the heart causes the heart to violently react. When this happens, the heart gives off a violent blast of magical energy, dealing radiant damage equivalent to the original attack in a 20ft radius sphere. If attacked by necrotic damage this ability does not trigger, and the heart takes double damage. Destroyed by: The heart has 100 HP total. If the heart reaches 0 due to physical damage, it violently collapses, dealing 10d10 radiant damage in a 300ft sphere. If the heart reaches 0 due to necrotic damage, the heart slowly begins to shrivel up, until it is about the size of a grape, at which point it collapses into dust.",
 "Eldritch Rod: Created by an unknowable primordial deity, it appears to be composed of dark oak into the shape of a long tendril. While the wielder may use it to have an additional 10 spell slots, any spell cast through it will have a wild effect to it of an evil nature. The woes of the user do not end there however, the rod with also wrap around the wrist of the caster permanently until a way to remove it is found. The longer one is attached, the more evil and chaotic in nature they will become, slowly connecting their mind to that of the incomprehensible deity that created the rod. This link could have it omniscient benefits however if the user seeks to please their new god. Destroyed by: The cursed wielder must cut off the arm that is binded, burning it along with the cursed artifact. If it is simply burned without sacrifice the character will have angered the deity, if it is not purified in flame the mental link will remain.",
 "Gravestone of Decay: By chiseling a name of a person, place, or concept into the stone, it will begin to wither away across the material plane and die. A person will take minutes, whereas a city could take months or years, and entire concepts (freedom, justice, etc.) could take centuries. Destroyed by: The only way to destroy it is for someone to selflessly carve their own name into the stone.",
 "The Key: It looks and feels very much like a normal key, but emits an intense magical aura. The key can open any door in existence. It can even be used, to create and open a door out of thin air that leads to where it’s user desires. It’s more than a mere teleport. It can be used to enter a parallel room in which the user is able to see the world without anyone seeing him. He can’t collide or interact with anything in the “real” world though. Even traveling between universes and realities is possible. The magical power can also be used to cast spells. Destroyed by: Since once you’ve unlocked a normal door, it stays unlocked, the doors that the Key opens stay open until you have left back through the door you have created. Thus, the only way to destroy the Key would be to open the room where you are unable to interact with anything, and then leave the key in that room, and then close the door. This would render the key stuck in a place which no longer exists. Bonus points for going into multiple layers of that room and leaving it deeper.",
 "The Rift Sigil: A sigil of an arcane rune, which, when placed on a surface creates a hole which expands 1d10 feet in all directions each week. The hole is an extradimensional rift which consumes objects and creatures that it encounters: the passage is one way, and creatures and objects that pass through it are destroyed. A creature may willingly enter the hole: a creature that does so survives the trip, as their willpower keeps them from being consumed by the void on the other side. They take 1d10 psychic damage per minute while here. Destroyed by: A runestone exists inside this realm: it is sentient, and has the following statistics. Rift Sigil Rune: AC 18, HP 100, SPD 0 S:10 D:10 C:18 I:22 W:22 C:22 Damage Immunities: Bludgeoning, Slashing, and Piercing damage made by nonmagical weapons, and psychic damage. Actions: At will: Confusion, Slow, Eldritch Blast (3 Blasts) Intelligence is the spellcasting ability for these spells.",
 "Spear of Thirst: This spear is +4 to hit and does 1d12 piercing damage plus 1d12 necrotic damage as it sucks fluids from the victim’s body. On a critical hit, the victim must make a DC 15 CON save or die, drained to a husk. The wielder gets 1d4 temporary HP each time it kills someone with a spear. Destroyed by: Submerge it in the body of a radiant creature like an angel. Or an undead: it can’t drink from the undead.",
 "Heart of Gold: An artifact that if the user holding it kills an unwilling good oriented user, all evil oriented characters in the nearby vicinity have a one in (number) chance of becoming increasingly good natured depending on how much good of a person the sacrifice was (up to DM’s discretion). However, this also works the other way around. Introduction: The protagonist could be either extreme good or extreme evil character killing like-oriented individuals. The PCs then find out about the heart. Destroyed by: The heart loses HP for each willing participant (depending on how much of a good or bad person they were). The heart originally starts with 1HP but increases with every unwilling participant of the ritual by 1 point.",
 "The Orb of Omniscience: Like a crystal ball with telepathy but anybody can use it any number of times per day. Best not to be destroyed, best if the party takes it for their own use. Destroyed by: Can be melted in lava.",
 "Sarcophagus of Rejuvenation: This ancient sarcophagus has incredible regenerative properties. Spending a short rest inside it restores all hitpoints and cures minor diseases. Spending a 8h inside of it can bring a man back from the brink of death, regenerate limbs and halt aging. Spending time inside of it without any injuries starts to drain a person’s humanity and they move closer to chaotic evil alignment. Destroyed by: The sarcophagus power can be disabled by placing a wonderus item of legendary power that’s intent is to cause harm. After that the sarcophagus is able to be destroyed by a magical weapon.",
 "Metallurgist’s Bible: This ancient book conveys upon it’s user the ability to make masterworks of war. Any weapon crafted with this artifact’s knowledge does double the amount of damage dice (1d6 shortsword –> 2d6). To retain this feature, the weapon must be soaked in the blood of an ancient red dragon once a year. Destroyed by: For every point of damage it takes, it immediately heals the same amount, and conjures a spectral weapon that seeks out it’s attacker and does the same amount of damage back. The only way to destroy it is to burn it in the fires of the forge where it’s first weapon was created.",
 "Clockwork Heart: While in the process of creating the Modrons, Primus created a clockwork heart. Since this heart wasn’t useful to making the Modrons he set it aside and forgot about it. In order to attune to this artifact you must hold it pressed to your heart during a short rest. The artifact slowly enters your chest and fuses with your heart. Unattuning kills the person because the artifact can’t be unfused from their heart. While attuned to this artifact you have advantage on death saving throws. Also you can open up a portal that leads to the plane of Mechanus or back to the material plane from Mechanus once per day. Modrons recognize Primus’ creation and will avoid fights with the person attuned the clockwork heart unless they are attacked. Once a creature has attuned to the Clockwork Heart, they begin to gradually lose the ability to feel emotion and instead become more logical. The process is slow, but speeds up significantly whenever an aspect of the heart is used (such as opening a portal to Mechanus or making a death saving throw only because of the advantage provided by the artifact). At the end of the process, the creature will be completely unable to experience any emotion and will become a logic-centered being. Destroyed by: The heart most be brought to a plane of chaos, tainting it. Once the heart is tainted, it can be destroyed as a normal object.",
 "The Ring of Infinite Wisdom: While wearing this ring you can tap into some of it’s infinite wisdom by sucking your thumb. While you are tapping into the ring’s wisdom in this way your current wisdom score increases by 10 up to 30 temporarily, and you even receive premonitions of the future. Destroyed by: The ring can only be destroyed in a 10 minute bath in the tub of the demon prince of foolishness.",
 "The Brain Staff: A long wooden staff with a pink orb on one end. It can efortlessly control the minds of any monster it’s user desires, and is able to control an infinite number of creatures at once. The user can give it simple instructions that the beast will follow until the day it dies, and keep commanding it. Destroyed by: The Staff is also able to control the minds of creatures emotionally bound to people, like pets and familiars. However, the person who the creature was bound with can attempt to break the spell by making the monster recognize him/her (which would take some time and Wisdom checks). When that happens, both the staff and it’s user are overpowered and explode in a 300 feet radius.",
 "The Infinite Locket: This mysterious pendant, when viewed, takes the viewer to a realm of their own memories, where they relive their favorite memories. The pendant slowly drains them of their life until nothing remains. Destroyed by: Must be opened and viewed to work. Because it can’t move, it’s very easy to become lost. If somebody closes the pendant, the spell is broken, but the victim is left with a feeling of longing.",
 "The Mark of Ancestry: This wrapping bonds to the user, allowing them commune with all those who have bore the mark before. They lend the user their wisdom and muscle memory, allowing the user to perform feats beyond that of their skill. Destroyed by: The mark technically steals a portion of the user’s soul when used. Additionally, if the mark becomes unbonded from a user, that user can never bond with the mark again, as their soul has already been collected.",
 "The Machiavellian Mirror: The Machiavellian Mirror allows viewers to cast spells through it or freely scry on any location or being the viewers are knowledgeable of. The mirror itself can also cast various mind control spells on targets visible in the mirror at the user’s behest (DM’s discretion on which and the number of uses per day). The insidiousness is multiplied because the mirror’s control is such that targets may not realize that they were influenced by a spell, especially if they were only instructed to do reasonable things. The mirror can even be used to disadvantage the charisma and wisdom saving throws of targets visible in it if needed. Other Suggestions: The Machiavellian Mirror’s owner should be intelligent and paranoid, someone who takes all sorts of mundane and magical precautions to prevent the mirror from being visible and even having a reflection, especially when not in use. The owner should also take precautions to make sure they are knowledgeable of even potential threats, and that they are visible and findable at all times (e.g. command a ring of spies). Destroyed by: If the Machiavellian Mirror can “see” its own reflection clearly, (e.g. another mirror or smooth surface polished finely is brought into close range in appropriate lighting conditions), the mirror spontaneously smashes itself into smithereens and becomes useless. Viewing another mirror through the Machiavellian Mirror does not count.",
 "Seed of Iron: As the first seed of the first iron-wood tree, the small seed holds the power of a strong nature deity. Whenever the seed is allowed to touch dirt, the seed immediately burrows into the earth. In a 2000ft radius, a forest of iron wood trees will begin to grow. They require no water and will dig through anything in their way. When the forest is done growing, a small tree made entirely of iron will appear in the center of the forest. In a year it will produce another seed of iron. The forest is neither good nor evil but flows with wild magic and may become home of fey creatures if given time. Destroyed by: If delt 75 points of damage the seed will be destroyed. When the forest is in the possess of growing the seed will stay 30 feet below where it was planted, surrounded by a hostile plant creature made of ironwood. If killed , the seed with die and the forest will die with it.",
 "The Dionysus Rod: The wielder of this item can loosen the inhibitions of anybody the wielder sees fit. Promiscuity, risk, eccentricity, and general impulsiveness. The more the rod is used, the more the wielder slips into madness, eventually being unable to control the rod’s power Destroyed by: It can only be broken by those who have broken free from the rod’s will.

 "The Dragpipes: A set of bagpipes where the bag itself resembles a dragon’s skull. The horns are exaggerated to form the reeds while the player blows through the mouthpiece connected to the back of the neck. The sound of the Dragpipes mimics the roars of different dragons so the player can convince or cause frightening presence to people making them think there is one, or many dragons.",

 "Conch Shell of the Officer: Legend says that this trumpet-like instrument was used by the Captain of the Guards in one of the ancient merfolk kingdoms. Used to rally troops to protect its nation. Sometimes it will drip out water, even when it is completely dry. It is inscribed with the words take me up.",
 "Fairy Bell: A tiny bell (not fairy-tiny, but regular human tiny) formed from silver and bronze. It has three icons on it. The longer it is rung in rhythm, the more cumulative the effect.",
 "Harp of Hades: Necromantic magic flows off this instrument. Though it looks like any angelic harp, its music has been known to drive people to depression, sorrow, and madness. Any necromantic magic in the area increases in potency. Those unfortunate to hear its song are likely to see visions of horrifying events that they never knew about, such as the murder of a loved one that was disguised as a natural death or a repressed memory.",
 "Marimba of the Wind: Under each tone bar is a secret compartment, perfect for a rogue to hide things. It also seems to bring impossible good luck to the player, though this cannot be proven.",

 "Organ of the Dreaming Land: When played, the nearest sleeping person will begin dreaming of the circumstances around the player. It cannot be played by anyone not of noble birth.",
 "Drum, That Which Calls Thunder: A drum of unknown origin. It appears to be made from traditional methods, with clay and perhaps crocodile skin. But there is something more ancient about this drum that you cant quite put your finger on. It turns any attack back toward the source (like turning back arrows to the people who shot them).",
 "Perfect Stillness - This strange instrument appears to make no sound when played; however, all those listening become hyper-aware of all of the sounds around them.",
 "The Masters Desk - An exquisitely smooth guqin, carved of cherry wood and perfectly tuned every time it is uncovered. Believed to have belonged to Guit Prox, the ancient Minotaur sage of lore.",
 "The Banns Fiddle - A light green Fiddle with a bow like a sapling, it is impossible to play the Banns Fiddle sadly. Every song has an upbeat, cheery tone. When sad songs are sung on the fiddle, there is a strange magic that turns them happy by the end, resulting in a strange retelling of many tragic sagas.",
 "Red Chuk - A small red box with a wooden handle, the Red Chuk creates an impressive percussive sound when struck. Anyone playing has advantage on any persuasion or performance check to act in accordance with courtly formalities for the next hour.");
$beach_encounters=array("A bearded and rag-draped man scrabbles in the sand. He’s looking for something he lost there. His mind, he says. It would be very bad for the world if he ever found it.",

 "A furrow has been dragged into the sand, leading down the mouth of a cave eroded into a low cliff. The furrow’s sides are stained with blood.",
 "A derelict ship picked clean by scavengers human and otherwise. Might still be good for firewood, or shelter lurking vermin.",
 "Two tiny armies form ranks in the sand and march into battle: one of red crabs climbing from the sea, another of white crabs from the dunegrass up inland. Even a few crabs are no threat to a human, but enough of them might be. If you ignore them they’ll go about their violent business and eventually one side will emerge victorious. If you aid one side against the other, the victors will reward you with cached spoils. Mostly tide-washed junk, but a handful of lost treasures as well. If you attack both sides they’ll band together to fight you.",
 "Mud slurries obscenely here. A water elemental and an earth elemental in a forbidden tryst. They’ll offer a modest bribe to get you to forget what you’ve seen, but plot sudden, stalking violence if you try to haggle or refuse. Don’t trust sand or saltwater after you’ve provoked them.",

 "A gang of urchins pick at the driftwood for anything that could be sold. They’ll work for a pittance and rob you blind in a blink if the opportunity arrives.",
 "Some patches of sand here are sunken and pitted with bubbles. Giant, carnivorous clams lurk beneath these. Watch your step, or you might lose a foot to their clamping shells.",
 "A whale, wide-eyed with terror, beaches itself before you. It won’t be long now til it dies. The whale’s pursuer waits in the shallows offshore, waves beating at its fins and spines. If the whale is not returned to the water, it will drag its glistening bulk ashore to retrieve it.",
 "A mass of imperishable plastic waste from a gone and forgotten civilization. Maybe worth something to a collector of curiousities or an alchemist.",
 "A patch of reeds. The sand around it seems recently disturbed. Underneath, a squad of blue-skinned goblins waits for a chance ambush. Their rattling breaths can be heard from the reeds just over the sound of the breeze.",
 "A galley and its crew, resting ashore. They’re looking for slaves to replace the ones who died at sea. They’ll pay for prisoners, as well as tips about vulnerable populations, but may try to capture you if you give an impression of weakness. If released the slaves on the galley will split evenly between those who flee and those who try to kill the crew.",
 "A marooned man with salt-cracked lips, escaped from exile on a ramshackle raft. He’s near death and deserved worse than marooning for what he did, but he also knows secrets you’ll want.",
 "An explorer from a distant land. She’s curious about the region and will report anything you tell her as truth back to her emperor, and in some months time when the full expeditionary fleet arrives they’ll act off that information.",
 "The severed tentacle of a sea monster, still grasping on the dying reactions of its ganglionic brain. It will flop after the closest thing generating vibrations (besides the waves), such as by stepping on the sand, and try to crush it. Hard to take on in a straight fight, easy to trick.",
 "Someone’s made an elaborate mandala in the sand. If you can step within it without disturbing its lines, you’ll be blessed with peace of mind and rapid healing while they stay there. The mandala will be wiped away when the tide comes in.",

 "A flock of sirens competing in a singing contest. Passers-by will be pressed into judging the winner. Losers will be furious.",
 "You spot something shiny ahead: the handle of a sword jutting up from the sand. There’s not much left beneath that hasn’t rusted to powder. Inscribed on the blade is part of a poem in a language only scholars still speak, florid in its dedication of the sword to a young prince by their father, the king. The sword’s enchantment is as broken as its blade. Where once its cut carried golden light that ate away at wounds, it now inflicts a contagious, blistering radiance.",
 "Assorted fish, bloated with eggs, pulled onto land by the parasites which have now grown larger than the fish’s mouths which once held them. The parasites are here to nest, and will protect their broods with maternal ferocity.",

 "A woman overturns rocks in a panic. In the distance angry shouts can be heard. She’s a selkie fleeing a wealthy merchant husband who forbid her from returning to the ocean, unable to find her skin. The husband has roused a mob to drag her back to their house and children. Not much time’s left before the mob arrives.",
 "The sand here is a riot of many hues, stained by wild magic. Magic cast while standing on this sand works chaotically. Sleeping on it brings prophetic nightmares. Eating it is mutagenic. All of these properties are preserved even if the sand’s removed from the beach.",
 "A boot sunk in to its ankle. It’s within a wide patch of hard-to-distinguish quicksand blocking the path. The boot is of high quality, but otherwise unremarkable.",
 "A lighthouse, the light of which is an uncanny green. Its keeper is more than a little mad, and spends all day gathering fireflies and their grubs. At dusk the keeper places his daily catch in a fine-mesh cage at the lighthouse’s top. Each night the fireflies feed on each other, becoming larger, brighter, and crueler. This will not end happily.",

 "A worn-away wisp of a dryad, clinging to the driftwood which was once her tree. Will try to commit suicide-by-adventurer by convincing them she’s more dangerous than she is to end her agony. If her bluff is called and she’s shuffled gently off this mortal coil, the dryad’s driftwood splits open to reveal a magic seed.",
 "A smuggler in a heavy cloak and a rowboat that seems too rotten to float. Direct light will reveal the smuggler’s true, skeletal face. She discovered a treacherous route out of the underworld then decided to continue the profession she followed in life. The dead smuggler offers goods not found among the living, and attempts to rope you into her schemes.",
 "The sand in this section of beach is greyish-red, iron-like, magnetically anomalous. Carrying ferrous metal through it can kick up obscuring clouds and rasping sandstorms.",
 "A man in a suit of armour sitting on a stone. Not really a man at all, but a knight-crab (like a hermit crab, but bigger, more dangerous, and uses armour instead of shells to house its vulnerable parts) grown a bit too large for its current home and looking to upgrade. Will mimic human behaviour as well as a clever animal can to lure prey closer before it attacks.",

Materials for a vehicle will be provided, including: old planks, nails, an inflated pig skin, and very hard melons. Sabotage of other racers is not only allowed, it’s encouraged.",

 "A worn leather case containing a smeared and mildewed scroll bobs in the waves. The scroll contains a random spell, but the damage to the scroll will mess with its activation. Maybe it’ll fizzle out, or affect a different target, or even become more powerful.",
 "A rusted machine. Its gears turn so slowly that the movement is nearly imperceptible, its ticking seeming perhaps to be your imagination. It will finally wind down in a matter of hours, and when it does it will explode. With tools (or fingers you don’t mind getting pinched off) the gears can be manually re- or unwound. Immersing the machine in water will delay its detonation indefinitely.",
 "A shark-man brute leaps from the water, positioning itself so that dazzling, blinding light shines off the surface at its back and into your face. Tries to intimidate its way to a toll of wealth and rations, fights reluctantly.",
 "An unhinged wizard rants and raves against the ocean. He seeks allies against it, and will attack anyone who seems to be in league with it (e.g. by sailing upon it, eating its fish, etc.).",
 "Hungry beachworms tunnelling below, bulging the sand above their passage. They can’t dig through solid rock, but are fast enough to overtake a running person. The sand above softens any blows against them except for when they lunge or watch periscope-like for prey.",
 "Galumphing kelp-freits wielding enormous shell-and-bone scissors. They work to separate the abominable in-betweens of land and sea: amphibians, sailors, seagulls, and so on, with the edge of their scissors if necessary (it’s most often necessary). The kelp-freits try to set up flanks between themselves, so they can combine their scissors to gruesome amputative effect.",
 "A drunken giant building an equally giant sandcastle. It’s dangerously oblivious in its scooping and molding, and if pestered will demand you act out its imaginings of what life in a castle is like with the frightened prisoners the giant’s already captured.",
 "A big, stoic sandstone face carved into the side of a hill. It will open its mouth to the treasure stashed within only for the person it was carved to resemble. The enchantment on it is rather crude, so a mask painted to look like it, its reflection in a mirror, and the like would all be sufficient to fool the face into opening. Dynamite will also open the face, but risks damaging the treasure within.",
 "A discarded coffer full of cursed silver coins. If carried they’ll tarnish any other precious metals you touch, and will return to your possession the night after you spend them. They’ll appear in your mouth if you’ve got no bags or pockets for them.",
 "A group of young nobles play polo as their bodyguards watch on. They’re growing bored with their game and eager for new amusements. They nobles unfamiliar with the possibility of their actions having negative consequences. Together their horses and jewelry are worth a small fortune to a discreet buyer who wouldn’t sell you out to the nobles’ parents.",
 "A decrepit yacht drifting down the shore. Its undead passengers believe themselves to still be alive and at an upscale party, dancing and drinking from dusty glasses. They’ll get violent if anything disturbs this illusion, and start off assuming any unfamiliar faces are servants. Some durable valuables are still onboard.",
 "A storm tears through the area, coming and going in maelstromous moments. Soon after the storm passes, a party of fairies riding albatrosses swoop down and ask which direction their quarry went. If told honestly you’ll wake up some days later with a bottle of lightning by your head. If they’re lied to you’ll find yourself caught in a deluge every time you try to sleep outside for the next month.",
 "A spattering of holes and the goblins digging them. They’ve got a waterlogged treasure map, the ink too smudged to read clearly, and are digging all over the approximate area of where “X” marked the spot.",
 "A collection of jars, some shattered, some whole, all caught in some muck. Within them is some goo. Drinking the goo inflicts a piscine mutation: gills, bulging eyes, legs fused into fins, skin turned to scales, and so on. Each jar’s goo inflicts a single mutation.",
 "An estuary where crocodiles lurk.",
 "A basket bobbing in the sea foam. Within is a wailing baby, several items of golden jewelry, and a note. The note explains that the baby is the youngest son of a king, sent downriver to escape the murderous attention of the crown prince. It further implores its reader to raise the baby well, take the jewelry as payment (though leaving one piece as a keepsake), and some day tell them of their royal heritage and duty to overthrow their tyrannous sibling.",
 "An impromptu bazaar halfway in the water. Merchants from land and sea have gathered here to trade goods only found in their respective environs.",
 "A holy oil spill shimmering on top of the water. It’ll still be potent if bottled. In the center of the spill a ghoul shivers atop a raft and cries for help.",
 "A crate of wax-sealed amphora full of wine that’s soured to vinegar. One of the amphora, painted with sharks instead of dolphins, is packed with cocaine or something similar.",
 "The way down the beach here is craggy, with rough waters slamming rougher rocks hemming in one side and a sheer cliff the other. The crags ahead are home to giant barnacles, glued in place but able to lash out at intruders with their tremendous penises.",
 "Some fishermen gambling around a barbecue pit.",
 "The sand here is full of sharp shards of rock and glass, cutting feet like caltrops if walked on. Goblins on stilts with bows and pikes are patrolling the area.",
 "Coral mounds dot this place and strange fish swim through the air. This is the ghost of an ancient reef now on land by the long movement of geology, lost in the memory of life. The ghostly animals behave as they would while alive, including attacking when hungry or provoked.",
 "Someone’s drowning, caught in a riptide. If rescued they’ll be grateful, but don’t have much to offer besides their service.",
 "A friendly horse trots up the beach to you. It’s a kelpie in disguise. If touched you’ll stick to it and it’ll gallop into the water.",
 "A floating dock that trails out to a prime fishing spot.",
 "A fresh shipwreck. There’s a three-way argument between some human scavengers, goblins, and fish-men as to how to split the spoils. They haven’t come to blows yet, but they’re close.",
 "A desiccated ocean chimera (eel for a tail, heads from a turtle, a pufferfish, and a seahorse, body like all four mashed together, breathes gouts of inky venom) placed above the high tide line. Contact with water will restore it instantly to lively hostility.",
 "A dire cormorant snacking on a splatter of dead fish washed ashore by a swell. Protective of its food but otherwise placid. Tameable.",
 "A party of adventurers like yourself, all naked and quite deranged from sun exposure and drinking seawater. If kept calm will tell confusing fragments of how they arrived at their current state.",
 "Colourful, frilly seaslug-men crowd around you and probe with soft appendages, babbling all the while. They’re tourists from the undersea realms. Curious about you, but unable to speak your language, and assume their gesticulations are more comprehensible than they are. At the first sign of violence they’ll vomit their guts out and crawl over each other to get back in the ocean.",
 "A sea stack engraved with abstract images. On moonless nights a coven of witches convenes to dance atop it with an octopoid demon, the master they’re sworn to.",
 "A salt evaporation pond. People from a nearby village sing work songs as they dredge the salt.",
 "An abandoned, algae-encrusted net. Entangled in it is a fish-bitten revenant on a quest to avenge its own murder, stymied by the fact that its hands and tongue have been eaten off.",
 "Gems ground to dust have been mixed into the sand here, glittering in ruby and sapphire hues. It’d be valuable but time consuming to sift it out here, but this risks attracting the attention of wandering monsters. The mixed sand could be packed up to be sifted elsewhere, but the ratio of sand-to-gem-dust could make it prohibitively heavy.",
 "A lifelike, gently smiling statue carved from salt, up to its knees in the sand. Those within the statue’s field of view (if its eyes could see) receive a penalty to their ability to resist outside influences on their mind.",
 "A fishing ogre with waves lapping at its shins. The ogre is currently distracted wrestling with a shark that’s bitten its line.",
 "A lightly sleeping lion-naga basking on the sun-warmed sand.",
 "Something golden glints in shallow water. It’s treasure, being used as a lure by fish-men. They’ll attack if you blunder into their environment.",
 "A lone mermaid, swimming down the beach from the opposite direction as you. Gives a wave, then goes on her way.",
 "The sea foam’s piled ashore here over your head, and widely enough that you can’t easily walk around it. Easy enough to push through it, but you can’t see in it past your nose. Something’s hiding in the foam, waiting for prey to wander in.",
 "A shrine to a maritime deity, shells and ribbons laid at its idol’s feet. A tired, old, snappy priestess and her bored apprentice live in a shack nearby and maintain the shrine.",
 "Goblins training gulls to shit in peoples’ eyes.",
 "A red tide laps at the shore. It’s infested with vampiric, symbiotic algae. A gaggle of infested people (evident by their crimson eyes and veins) are bathing in the stuff. They try to ply you with drugs and good company to offer up some blood (any sort will do), and become increasingly agitated if you do not. Their preferred mode of attack is to spike the dose of whatever they can get you to take with a sedative and drain you while you’re passed out.",
 "A sea turtle nesting site. You’ve arrived at just the right time to see the mass hatching. Predators will be gathering soon to pick off the baby turtles before they reach the water. Maybe you’ll be joining them.",
 "A sudden fog rolls in. Vague lights can be seen through it. Lanterns? Will-o’-wisps? Lures? Perhaps it’s better to avoid them than investigate.",
 "A burial at sea. Mourners place treasures on the boat of their chief, then set it ablaze. It’ll sink some distance out. Polite observers will be invited to join the festivities to follow.",
 "An execution. The offender is being buried up to their head below the high tide line. Someone in the gathered crowd is being held back, screaming that the one being buried has been falsely charged. By law they’ve got until the tide comes in to prove it.",
 "A retreat of mystics contemplating the mysteries of the ocean.",
 "The tower of a heretical astrologer attempting to capture the moon and stars in their reflection off the water.",
 "A floating hull overcome with lead-grey fungus, its crew dead by a saprophytic plague they picked up on distant shores. Some immature sprouting stalks already release thin streams of spores. If not burned or otherwise disposed of the hulk might fully fruit and infest the whole region.",
 "The sand here is spongy, grey, mercury-infused. The fumes rising off it can induce delusions. Some goblins who think themselves human are already here huffing the stuff.",
 "A tide pool with a sheepishly dying merman stuck in it. Needs some convincing that surviving is worth the embarrassment of his situation, but will vouch for you to other his underwater allies if rescued.",
 "A nuckalavee charges from the surf. A tireless pursuer, but can’t cross freshwater.",
 "A resplendent coconut palm held sacred by local people. They know, but don’t speak openly of, a ritual by which you can remove an evil presence from someone’s mind (possession, madness, domination, enchantment, etc.) by trepanning them, drilling to the core of a coconut from the sacred palm, and placing the holes together to draw the evil presence from their head and into the coconut. Trees grown from coconuts used in the ritual are twisted things, bearing the mark of the evil they contained.",
 "A group clad in immaculate white robes, browbeating some reluctant few members into following them willingly into the ocean. Apparently a suicide cult. Non-members are proselytized to, and asked not to interfere.",
 "A dwindling iceberg-fortress run aground too far south by unfavourable currents. Its garrison of snow elves are paranoid towards outsiders but desperate for direction to a colder place. It’s a toss-up as to which sentiment will win out.",
 "A self-crewed golem-ship in need of a captain. Willing to kidnap someone to serve the role.",
 "The secret dockyards of a nearby nation, where they’re developing experimental ships. Its guards will be aware of your perimeter breach (though not your exact position) and on high alert.",
 "A fisher-monk stands posed upon a rock in impossible stillness, wielding a barbed harpoon. He waits for the vanishingly rare rainbow-urchin to pass by, a creature with spines of light of every hue and shade. When he spots it he’ll strike with unerring precision. If interrupted before then the monk will be incomprehensibly salty.",
 "Sargasso spreads before you, from the beach to the distant horizon. Everything you’ve ever lost beckons from its green tangles. This is a portal to the Sargassium, a world where all things can be found again, or where you too might be lost forever.",
 "The water withdraws, the horizon swells. A tidal wave is coming.",
 "A fish-man flags you down, says they were supposed to meet with a representative from a nearby village to discuss trade agreements, tribute, and breeding rights. As that representative is late, the fish-man explains, you will have to do. Some time in to the negotiation (or fighting, or whatever else) the representative will arrive and react to you based on how you’ve argued for the village’s interests.",
 "You glimpse a howling whirlpool and waltzing waterspouts a long way from the shore. The visible surface signs of the weapons of an underwater war.",
 "While walking along on the sand, you suddenly look down and see a turtle crawling toward you. You reach down and flip it over onto its back. The turtle lies there, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its flippers, trying to turn itself over, but it cannot do so without your help. You are not elping. Why?");

What I dont see, doesnt exist. And what comes into existence is the power of my omnipotent subconscious keeping me from being bored by keeping part of my Will hidden from me.

Finally, a single puff quickly grows to the size of a grape and bursts into a small cloud of spores that quickly spread in a breeze, infecting those around the host, as well as leaving a large pockmark in its place. The fungus, while growing inside the host, causes ever growing feelings of loss and loneliness, pushing the host to seek out more and more companionship. If the fungus is allowed to reach fruition and spore, the sense of loneliness transitions into a permanent and inconsolable state of depression.");

The creature can make a Constitution saving at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the creature is no longer blinded and its movement speed is returned to normal.",
 "Falling Leaf: A mottled copper scimitar that is colored in the shades of autumn. Etchings of various leaves cover the flat of the blade and sway gently as though exposed to an invisible wind. The scimitar is a +2 magical weapon innately, with an additional property that can be activated if the wielder attunes to the blade. Once per day, the wielder may use an action to use the blade’s Shroud of Autumn property if they are attuned to the scimitar. The wielder calls forth a swirling cyclone of leaves around themselves in a 5-foot radius for up to a minute. While the cyclone is active, all ranged attacks made against the wielder have disadvantage. If the property is used while within an area with moderate density foliage, the cyclone instead has a 10-foot radius and causes all melee attacks to be made with disadvantage as well. The wielder also gains the ability to use their reaction to cause a ranged attack passing through the cyclone to automatically miss its target. The wielder may stop the cyclone and have the leaves drift away using a bonus action on their turn. If the property is used while within an area with high-density foliage, the cyclone gains new benefits in addition to the previous improvements. The cyclone instead has a 15-foot radius, which is considered difficult terrain while the cyclone is active, and all ranged attacks not made by the wielder automatically miss if they enter the cyclone. One time while the cyclone is active, the wielder can form blade replicas from the swirling leaves to attack a multitude of foes. By doing so, the wielder uses an action to make a single melee weapon attack with the scimitar against any number of creatures inside the cyclone, with a separate attack roll for each target.",
 "Coral Marstaff: A reef-like quarterstaff that is covered in suspended globules of water which act as portals to the nearest body of water. Reaching in one can retrieve fish or marine animals up to five feet long. If used with two hands and braced it will halve the damage of all fire-based attacks in a twenty-foot radius.",
 "Heart of Pando: A symbiotic sapling that can bond itself to an individual and creates its own forest of cloned trees over time. Should you die the trees can birth up to three new avatars of yourself over time. Your clones are named Harold, Bob, and Herbert but should you die a forth time you become one with the forest forever.",
 "Primal Crystals of Akaroth: Each crystal representing the four elements adds 1d4 damage of that type to your attacks. Your animal wildshapes are now made out of those elements (fire, water, earth, air) should you choose.",
 "Moon Sickle of Cressk: Using this platinum, silver, and gold weapon to harvest mistletoe under light of the full moon lets you make a Druid Grove permanent in only half the time (6 months in-game). If you happen to find a suitable stump you can leave this weapon and the requisite material components in a forcecage within the Druid Grove and in one year it will have been made permanent by trapping a small part of you in a time loop just long enough to complete the ritual. Occasionally it has been known to fail and release a druid from the time loop should they die elsewhere.",
 "Mask of the Crystal Sea: an egg shaped mask cut from an angular, opalescent crystal. The wearer of this mask not only gains +3 to perception checks to spot fey creatures but also receives fey as a bonus language. The fairies of the western wood call the mask Syliang meaning god shorn.");

$evil_contract_asking_price=array("Use of your voice for a day. Your voice (which is from someone true and pure of heart) is used to chant a ritual with thousands of other borrowed voices to do something very evil. The evil ritual tainted your voice and now lawful beings have taken notice of the rituals completion and don’t really care for the defence that you weren’t there, your voice was the one chanting.",
 "You must sacrifice a percentage of money to the demon each time you make/find money.",
 "The demon appears as an attractive figure matching the Player Character's greatest desires, perhaps even the one they are in love with. The demon asks the Player Character to kiss them, and to kiss them like they would someone they love. An offspring is created by the kiss, a half demon half [Player Character Race] which grows rapidly towards adulthood.",
 "The demon requests a piece of the Player Character's soul; not their entire soul, but just a piece of it. Permanently reduces the maximum HP of the Player Character by 20 and they have disadvantage on CHA checks when dealing with Paladins, Clerics, or general members of the Clergy.",
 "You must betray a party member who is not aware of your contract and who is your friend by stealing from them, spreading rumors about them or something else to amuse the devil. It has to be clever.",

 "The demon will request that the Player Character give them their first born (or in the case of the Player Character already having children, their next) child for one day during his or her first week of life. The demon will feed the child 3 drops of its own blood. The child grows strong and powerful from this treatment. He or she beomes forever an indentured servant to the demon. The demon has made this pact dozens of times, in doing so the demon has collected an army of powerful beings.",
 "The Character must do a small evil thing each day. It's minor, but it it helps spread misery. Kick a puppy, steal groceries from a senior citizen, trip a blind person.",
 "The Character must perform a moderately evil thing each day. It's still not killing, but it is full of hate and brings pain. Grafitti a house, send letters to soldier's widows that state they are burning in hell, terrorize a household of minor or monster races, break store windows, hand out pamphlets decrying the existence of a particular sub group (religious or otherwise), steal food from the starving, rob an orphanage, etc.",
 "The Character must perform a single truly evil act. These are the truly evil acts. Assault, murder, etc. Things the get life sentences, if not execution or exile.",
 "The character must say something opposite of their nature to a loved one at least once per day, with the number increasing from day to day depending on how many things the character does against the demon/devil’s desires.",
 "Devil: collect on another contract made several decades ago. The terms of this contract remain unknown. The mortal who signed the first contract is advanced in years and either doesn't remember the contract due to their memory failing, or starts begging that there is still time.",
 "One of their eyes. Perhaps the players fight a demon with the single eye in the future?",
 "Abbysal: 66.6% of all blood for the next googol of years or the end of the claimant's life, whichever comes last, must be left at a altar to dark powers. This allows one to as a standard action call a random abyssal ally once daily, who will do tasks for the claimant. The ally may demand additional payment for services rendered, depending on the complexity of the task.",
 "Infernal: 66.6% of all income for the next googol of years or the end of the claimant's life, whichever comes last, must be left at a altar to dark powers. This allows one to as a standard action call a random fiendish ally once daily, who will do tasks for the claimant. The ally may demand additional payment for services rendered, depending on the complexity of the task.",
 "Anyone who signs the contract will always be slightly outshone by their companions in any legends told. Saved a kingdom? The bard will mention everyone, including you, but your stanza will be just that much less remarkable than the others. This only applies to secondhand accounts: anyone who witnesses your deeds will see them as they truly are. Complication: The fiend itself is a Glory Leech, and its sustenance is the renown of those it gives contracts to. After you've done enough deeds, and the Glory Leech has nourished itself on your relinquished fame, it has the strength to take your place...either actually possessing you, or manifesting as the ideal version of you who everyone unrelated sees as having really done all your great deeds.",
 "The fiend requires as its price that you have a recurring cold. It doesn't hamper you mechanically (or perhaps gives only a small disadvantage to pure CON checks, of which there are few), but you are Always. Sick. Your companions notice it, NPCs notice it; it feels like you have Fantasy Allergies and no restorative magic can remove it. Complication: The fiend had a powerful curse bestowed upon itself, and has found a way to gradually rerout and 'metabolize' that curse through you. After 1/5/10/50 years of dealing with this cold, one day you wake up to find that it is gone once and for all. However, the fiend is now no longer restrained by its curse. It shows up to thank you for your assistance...and perhaps, for good or ill, it does something more.",
 "The fiend wants your nickname. If you have multiple nicknames, it will demand one that has emotional or personal significance, though not necessarily your most cherished one. Complication: true names have power, but nicknames have their own, weaker power. The fiend is able to summon you to its infernal realm every so often, as per some backwards summoning spell. You appear as a ghostly form and can't be permanently injured, though you may have to fight or undergo tasks. The fiend can't torture you or hurt you willingly, but it can command you to perform duties as a summoned creature would.",
 "The fiend wants one fingernail from your non-dominant hand. It pulls them out with a pair of shiny, black pliers. The fingernail never grows back. Complication: that's a really damn creepy thing to ask for. Why in the Nine Hells did they want a fingernail? What are they doing with it? Ugh. That's gonna bother you.",
 "The fiend is drawn to the light that you spread -- literally. If you are a spellcaster or other magic user, all of your magical effects get noticeably dimmer , though no harder to perceive i.e. this doesn't change them to Subtle Spell. If you cast a spell that produces light as an intended effect (the Light cantrip, Daylight, Moonbeam, Sunburst, etc., though up to DM discretion), either the radius of light is lowered, or one damage die from the spell's damage is demoted/removed entirely. If you're a non-caster, your torches sputter and go out much faster than others' do, and any magic items you use that are designed to cast light are reduced in radius.",
 "The fiend picks up a small rock off the ground and enchants it with a spell you cannot discern (on a successful Arcana check or casting of detect magic, you realize it's from the Divination school). The fiend then demands that you always keep this rock on your person. You are magically bound to this: if the rock is left behind or discarded, it returns to your pack whenever you aren't paying attention. The rock is always there and tends to get in the way, but imposes no mechanical penalties. Complication: The rock is a powerful scrying stone, and the fiend is able to watch you at any time, for as long as it wishes. Not only does the fiend enjoy spying on the Material Plane, but it has also been known to rent out the use of this rock to other fiends. Anyone who uses the rock cannot directly harm you or your companions...though nothing stops them from screwing with you in potentially terrible ways.",
 "The souls of your victims.",
 "A single drop of the PC’s blood. PC’s family was blessed by [Good being] generations ago for reasons. The [Evil being] than used their blood (couldn’t been taken, only given) in a ritual to weaken/torture/kill [Good being] and steal the item/person/prize/location they were guarding.",
 "Demon Only: The demon states that the player's fee is waived, as the demon insert excuse here [likes them/is feeling generous/was or will be paid for doing the task/etc.]. As a token of the contract, the player must place a small scrap of moss in an obscure window frame, preferably in a ruin. The demon will attempt to deceive the player if asked about it, saying it's a form of ritual in it's 'layer' (means nothing in the abyss) to ensure a contract is completed. Complication: the scrap of moss is a fledgeling demon [if D&D, Alkilith from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes], and a portal to the Abyss. It can be recognized as fiendish by abilities or spells, and very few hit points. If left unchecked for d10 years, the moss will overgrow the window and open a gate to the Abyss.",
 "Act as an embassy to their side for XYZ 'missions'/years. Example errand: Bring a box of junk to the hermit in an abandoned swamp cave as a personal present. The hermit was cursed centuries ago, locked away, stripped of all their power by a local shaman to wither and die. The hermit was a Hag Mother whose curse can only be broken by receiving an honest gift from a mortal (which would never happen under normal conditions due to her blood thrist and malice), which through proper coaching from the [Evil being], you’ve just broken.",
 "Wants your shadow. Without a shadow, being the negative space made by your presence in light, you are often forgotten about. Left out of stories, memories, often surprise people you are in the middle of conversations with when you speak even if you haven't moved ('OMG Gorgan, I didn't see you there, dont sneak up on me like that'). Since you don't seem to block light, you are often colder than normal and animals often don't like to be in your presence.",
 "The PC will have to surrender the soul of their most beloved one. Wife, to child, to best friend. The Demon demands it for the contract to be fully bound. If the contract is broken, the soul is sent to the deepest depths of hell. But if the contract is completed to satisfaction, the soul is returned, after being exposed to hell for maybe a day to a week.",
 "A long term (read: perpetual) loan agreement. On the 6th day of the month, you must deposit a coinpurse with 66 gold pieces in it into a baroque ritual box. When closed, the box consumes the coins. Woe betide you should you come short on your payment. Mammon's approach to debt restructuring is more cruel than any mortal moneylender.",
 "Your most precious memory and the memories required to make sense of it. Sets up for a great revealed twist in the PC's own backstory.",
 "Your true name. The demon takes possession of your name, and can use it as a source of power over you. Whenever someone calls you by your true name you take 1d4 psychic damage.",
 "A small metal rod from the material plane. This is to serve as material component for Plane Shift to his other followers.",
 "The demon just wants a friend. No tricks, no gimmicks, they've just become so lonely that they're willing to open up the possibility of having a mortal friend. They'll check in with the player from time to time, ask how they're doing, maybe even offer help or ask a favor of their own. (this one's devious, because the player will constantly think and be waiting for an ulterior motive, and questioning somebody who actually just wants friendship).",
 "Just one eye. Turns out the eyes are the window to the soul, but the fiend only needs it cranked open halfway to see in. Giving up your eye tells the fiend your alignment, which in turn makes it easy for them to then exploit that knowledge to slowly bend you to their own alignment, so that when you die your soul goes to Hell/The Abyss and they can claim it as their own.",
 "Place a fist sized rock on a cobblestone bridge at exactly 9am tomorrow. Unknown to the player, a very important noble has fallen deathly ill and the cure will pass over the bridge on its way to the castle. The rock causes just enough of a delay that the noble dies, leaving their heir, a devote of said Demon/Devil in power.",
 "A wager: If the player dies in the next (X) days, the demon gets his or her soul. If the player manages to survive, the demon gets nothing. The demon cannot directly harm the player, but will do everything else within its power to see that the player meets an untimely end.",
 "Your thirdborn son. Whatever you were getting in the contract wasn't worth a first or second born child.",
 "You must defile three holy sites of three different deities, the closer to Lawful Good the better. Preferably done by a less experienced demon/devil that uses brute force to gain influence instead of subjugation and trickery.",
 "The devil wants you to set him up in business. S/he will grant your boon in return for: a nice townhouse, endowed with sufficient capital that the maintenance and servants are paid in perpetuity; a shop in the poshest market square; the services for five years of a master in that trade (to teach it to the devil); an endowment for food, drink, etc., all top of the line; the tools, materials and capital sufficient for the trade; your enthusiastic marketing of his/her business; etc. This is a straight-up deal; the devil is sick of the politics of hell and just wants to live a mortal lifetime as a trader in [your pick, something fairly mundane, like tailor or mercer]. It's gonna cost you way more gold than you might originally think, but you'll get that boon fair and square. Now, the devil doesn't intend to deal in souls, but business is business, and if something comes up that can be done subtly...",
 "The head of a well-known and beloved holy leader/monk whose God opposes the demon/devil.",
 "For you to carry a mysterious egg and protect it. Unknown to the players, the egg comes closer to hatching every time something dies within 30ft of it and players close to it gradually gain a small amount fire damage on their attacks. Egg can hatch into a physical form for the demon or a monster of your choice (friendly or not).",
 "Wants to watch you sleep and consume your dreams. Promises it will only take one night. But the next morning, the character finds that she remembers all her dreams... But her goals and motivations in life (which are another kind of 'dreams')? Those are gone. Forever. Character can develop other dreams (goals, motivations) but the ones that were taken can never be pursued again. Because the character simply doesn't care about them anymore. This can be very broad. For example, if the character was especially greedy about loot and gold... well, that's not the case anymore. Or limited to character specific quests only. The character doesn't care about the mystery of who killed her parents, for example.",
 "The carcasses of 49 cats, to be delivered in a single bulk payment.",
 "Your Name: Your name is erased from your memory, and that of any who know you, and any written work, such as non-demonic contracts.",
 "Your lineage.",
 "Love - The fiend has either grown sentimental/nostalgic over a past life where he could love, or he simply wants to know what all the fuss is about. While you retain control, he experiences life through your heart and soul for one week. You can feel his presence and hear his whisper as he urges you to spend time with your loved ones, possibly threatening them if you don't do as he says.",
 "Faith - The fiend tells you a secret truth that shakes your faith in a deity or ideal that you hold most valuable. You are cursed with never being able to speak it, or perhaps simply nobody believes you, but you know it to be true.",
 "Power - The fiend believes in equal exchange. If your contract is for political power, he takes your physical/magical power, and vice versa. The magnitude of the deal must remain equal on each side. If you can give him someone else's power, that's fine too, as the two signatories still ended up with a balanced deal.",
 "Gore - The fiend asks you to spill lots of blood for him. Not now, but over time. He just likes blood and guts, and now you're starting to like it too. Everything you kill, you have an urge to mutilate, and every so often, you see the face of the fiend smiling up at you from a pool of blood.",
 "The devil challenges the claimant to a test of skill and talent. PC has 6 days to prepare for this contest in whatever way they see fit. On the day of the contest, they must beat an appropriate DC [50?] - if they succeed, they win, free and clear, a valuable prize thematically suited to skill tested- but if not, the devil gets the PC's soul. PC's party has a number of days/weeks/months to retrieve the claimant's soul from the thematically appropriate hell before it is lost forever.",
 "For every favor you ask for from the demon, the demon takes 5% of your remaining life span. This doesn't stack, it just continues to take 5% every time. If you have 70 years left, it takes 3.5 for the favor. If you used another favor immediately after that, it takes away 5% of the 66.5 years left remaining.",
 "The Demon/devil asks for the left shoe of every creature or person you kill. This is just for spite.",
 "The devil stores a soul in the character for safekeeping. This soul may occasionally force the player to commit evil acts. Later you can have a powerful warlock hunt the character intending to retrieve the soul.",
 "The character gets the halfling lucky trait but for a roll of 20 instead of 1. The fiend is siphoning their luck for unknown reasons.",
 "If the character ever verbally expresses love for another person, that person will be filled with hatred towards the character.",
 "A cult that worships the devil has been infiltrated by a holy paladin. The devil requests they find and kill this paladin before the devil is banished. (It is also to be assumed that this devil will provide reasonable assistance.)",
 "The devil brands the player with their symbol. That character is now sensitive to sunlight and vulnerable to radiant damage, any healing they receive from a good-aligned divine power is halved, good clerics might instinctively think the character is evil, etc.",
 "The character must mark every living creature they kill with the symbol of the devil they entered the contract with. After an hour the bodies are summoned to the devil who does what it pleases with the corpses.",
 "A cult worships the devil whose contract the character signs, and the devil asks the character to eradicate this cult. It turns out the cult was rather annoying and the devil just didn't want to be summoned so often.",
 "The fiend needs four waterskins of blood from four specific creatures. The blood will be used to create a powerful 'pet' for the fiend which may or may not attack the character later on.",
 "The fiend asks that you irreparably break the trust of someone who is dear to you. Who’s trust you betray is up to you, but the fiend can tell by reading your soul whether the bond was strong or if the betrayal was true. The trust must be shattered irreversibly; if even a small amount of faith remains between you and your dear one, the fiend will not consider the condition met.",
 "The fiend insists on a request that has two parts. Firstly, you must capture the soul of someone you truly love and bring it to the fiend. The specific person or method of capture does not matter, just that they are important to you. Secondly, you must design a torment for the fiend that you believe would be the most excruciating for that particular person. The fiend expects you to use your knowledge of the person to assist you in your torture-crafting, and if it determines that you did not put your best effot into personalizing their eternal suffering, you fail the condition. If the fiend approves your torment, it sees to it that it is administered to the person’s soul for all eternity, leaving you and them mired in the knowledge that you are responsible for their everlasting pain.",
 "The fiend requests the soul of an innocent child from an enlightened race, personally slain by a sworn defender of the innocent. How the situation arose or how the soul is delivered do not matter; the fiend only cares that the circumstances set forth in its condition are met. The fiend may increase what it offers in exchange if you personally and purposefully create the circumstances that cause the slaying, with its pleasure deepening the more dramatic the conditions of the death.",
 "Your skill. The infernal takes one of your skill proficiencies (DMs choice). Not only does your skill drop to +0, but you are (meta-game) literally unable to ever pass that kind of skill check ever again. Any magical bonuses, additional modifiers, later level placements all become null.",
 "A part of your personal essence. Infernal takes from you a stat points.",
 "Your memories. Infernal takes from you all or specific memories from the PC. They choose memories specific to your character like “every memory of a loved one” so they are a stranger to you, where something specific is located like the magical mcguffin on their quest, a learned action such as a class power or magical spell (never able to be learned again), or for fun and games, basic knowledge like horses exists or that you cant breath underwater. MORE MALICIOUS VARIANT: The Infernal doesn’t care what memory they take, the whole contract was so that when they scan your memory for “which memory they want”, they actually get to see hidden information you wouldn’t have volunteered.",
 "A year of service.",
 "Your word of honor... Literally. You can no longer say the word honor.",
 "I demand your sword and shield, at a time of my choosing. This debt will be paid 3 times. So, mid fight, our plucky hero swings their mighty sword only to see it vanish before their eyes. As a member of a party, the protection of his allies is his shield and he watches them vanish too, off to fight some ancient foe of the Demon while he stands here unarmed against what was once an easy encounter...",
 "Perform a ritual (pour the blood of X) into the mouth of an aasimar (celestial souls are tasty).",
 "To learn the true name of another planar being.",
 "A child's innocence. You needn't give it to the demon, but you must take it away.",
 "The demon wants the ability to 'sleep'. This demon lost its own ability to sleep in a different deal with another group of adventurers. You no longer need to sleep, but never truly feel 'rested'. Should you ever have the need to go unconscious, you are semi-aware, just unable to move.",
 "The emotion in your voice. From now on, you speak in a monotone voice no matter your feelings.",
 "You must mildly inconvenience a specific person before a specific time, enough to delay them no less than 5 minutes. The demon may or may not inform you the target has a very important destiny they are unaware of, but hinges on them arriving at their destination before a specific time.",
 "You must enter a church and convince a specific clergyman to step outside the walls of the church, where the demon awaits.",
 "There's an upcoming election and you must vote for or endorse the candidate of the demon's choosing.",
 "The dying scream of a God. Good luck figuring out which one to kill … and then figuring out how to kill a god.",
 "You must gain the trust of an innocent, and then brutally break it. The demon doesn’t particularly need anything, he just wants to cause havoc.",
 "The fiend wants to see the material plane. In exchange for its favor, it gets to hitch a ride behind your eyes for a time. While it is there, you will trip any spell, ability, or creature that detects the presence of evil and/or fiends. You cannot enter holy sites whose alignment is not adjacent to that of the fiend. Further, it may be manipulating your dreams for its own purposes.",
 "An arm and a leg. They don't care whose.",
 "You must aid a devil by infiltrating a church, temple or holy place with his minions. This will utterly and permanently corrupt the very foundation of an otherwise righteous institution.",
 "The fiend asks you to plant a black, spiny seed the size of a human thumb in the middle of a lush, green, verdant forest. Given d4 days to sprout, it will slowly begin to devour the local ecosystem as it grows into a massive knotted tangle of black, greasy vines with finger-length thorns. In d6 years, an area of roughly 3 square miles is converted into an Abyss-like landscape. All wildlife there becomes tainted and demonic, and demons frequently appear there.",
 "A weapon granted to you by the demon hungers for life; if you don't use it to end a life twice per six days, the weapon turns on you and begins feasting on your flesh, dealing d10 damage and forcing a -3 penalty to STR and DEX on you until you kill something. A demon offering such a deal will almost always leave that part out.",
 "The demon grants you a magical pistol, and a satchel of seven magical bullets; the gun will only fire the seven bullets granted by the demon. The first six will instantly strike wherever the shooter aims, without fail; the first six ranged attacks made with this gun cannot miss, the gun will not jam, and the attack will always be a critical hit, as long as the magic bullets are used. The seventh shot, regardless of whether or not you use the demon's bullets, will be controlled by the demon and will always strike where it wants, and will always be a critical hit.",
 "The devil requires that you kidnap a famous bard so that he may use the bard as his 'ringer' in a musical battle against a demon. The bard is also being pursued by the demon's people, and has warded himself against any direct fiendish interference.",
 "Some of your experience. You loose your most recent level.",
 "A share in your success. Anytime you pick up any valuables (coins, gems, magical artifacts ect.) there is a 50% chance it goes to the demon.",
 "An arm and a leg. Luckily, they are generous enough to provide some old spares they don't need. Replace one of your arms and legs with that of a random humanoid.",
 "To wear the face of your one true love.",
 "The knowledge of your favorite food. Nevermore will you taste it, nor remember the taste. Only the loss and the uncertainty remains: was this the food? Was this the way your mother made it?",
 "Asks to possess you for one day of your life. Given the choice of any day of your life, chooses the day you were born and changes your whole life.",
 "Make the demon something. Carve it from stone, or bone, or wood. Spend precious hours, stolen minutes, your sweat, your tears on the object. Make something more beautiful than you ever believed that your hands could craft. Burn it.",
 "Interrupt a wedding when the officiant asks if anyone has any objections. Use your imagination.",
 "Your brother/ sister / best friend's favorite pet. Kill it. I don't want the body. I just want to know that it is dead by your hand.",
 "Sit by the bedside of a dying man or woman, and tell them a bad joke. Make sure it's the last thing they ever hear.");
$fantasy_drugs_and_their_effects=array("Slithersoup: a liquid that when consumed in large quantities, makes you feel like your bones are jelly and commonly causes people to writhe on the ground like snakes when taken in higher doses.",
 "Feydust: A soft white powder that, in the right light, shines with soft blues and red. The powder tastes like burnt ozone, which makes it evident that it needs to be snorted. Use causes bonuses to IQ based tasks but also makes its user seek it out more and more for increasingly trivial tasks.",
 "Halfling Weed: Most often dried, chopped, and smoked. Causes extreme emotions to abate and induces near euphoric mellow-ness and, occasionally, a user will experience mild hallucinations. Side effects include increased appetite and red, puffy eyes.",
 "Blue sand: A substance similar to fine sand found at the beach, only that it’s deep blue colored. Consumed through the nose. One to five doses (depending on Wis or Con modifier) are enough to develop an addiction. Early effects (one to three weeks): Enhanced perception, athletics & acrobatics Following deterioration of body and mind: First (after four weeks of constant consumption): One exhaustion stack per three days without a dose. Second (after six weeks): Negative modifiers (-2) on all attributes and disadvantage on all skills. Third (after 8 weeks): Death.",
 "Dream Flake: Thin slivers of a dried, black fungus. When place between cheek and gum, it induces hallucinations and euphoria. When smoked, the user enters an extremely vivid waking dream, which can last for hours. Extended use blackens the teeth and make bad trips more common. Addictive.",
 "Wrymwood: looks like a cinnamon stick but smells of fungus. Grind some up and put in a tea. When drunk, it provides a psychedelic trip for 1d4 hours (halved on a DC 15 con ST and doubled when failing by more than 5).",
 "Grellsvice: A drug usually administered as an oral capsule made from the spikes at the end of a grell’s tentacles. Effects last for roughly two hours on a regular 200 mg dose, and leave the user with a four-hour hangover of sorts. The main draw to grellsvice is a tingling sense in the muscles and extra-sensitive motor functionality. This comes with a strong euphoric rush whenever a new body part is moved. The drawback is the lack of motor functionality during the hangover and the incredibly dulled sense of touch accompanied with it.",
 "Sundrop: a bright yellow/orange liquid, naturally incandescent, as if it was a liquefied ray of sunshine (henceforth the name). Originally used as a magically synthesized antidepressant, Sundrop when consumed tricks the user into believing that they are happy, as it quite literally gives them ‘warm feelings’. Over usage may leave the user feeling withered between uses, as their dependency has rendered them unable to produce dopamine and serotonin. Over time users also commonly begin to build tolerances to Sundrop, requiring greater quantities to be consumed to maintain the effect. Overdosing on Sundrop causes feverish conditions, as the drug radiates through the users veins, ultimately burning them alive from the inside out.",
 "Patch: It works similarly to ecstasy, expanding yourself to feel the sensations all around you. It grants the ability to speak with plants and animals for 1d4+1 hours, and the comedown has a DC15 CON save. Failing the save adds one point of exhaustion immediately after waking from the first long rest you take, and lasts until completing the next long rest.",
 "Lakua: ground silvery bark from a type of tree only found deep in swamps. Low dosages are generally taken orally. Heavier users often make a paste to apply to their gums. Addicts may smear it into cuts. It gives an adrenaline rush and time seems to slow down but the duration of the high is short. Death comes from heart failure or self-neglect. Psychologically addictive not physically.",
 "Zooterran: Made from refined Exem plums. Alters ones sense of direction and causes one to only turn right when faced with a left/right choice.",
 "Blackroot: This lichen grows on large rocks and boulders found above timberline (the elevation at which trees do not have enough oxygen to grow). When chewed on, it causes the user to have a pleasant, tingling sensation of the lips, tongue, and gums. As well, it can give the user a sense of mental sharpness and alertness. If swallowed, it causes nausea and vomiting if the user fails a DC 13 Constitution check. If used for 1d6 hours continuously, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If failed, they experience nausea, but if passed they gain advantage on Perception checks for the next 1d4 hours. Not inherently addictive, though if used for 1d12 days in a row, the user will feel extremely groggy if they do not use it every morning.",
 "Deluge: Packaged in single-dose vials, ingesting this ethereal blue liquid gives subjects temporary access to spell-like abilities of varying degrees; usually cantrips and 1st Level spells, but sometimes more powerful spells depending on the purity of the substance. However, the temporary magic abilities come with a price: each time an individual ingests Deluge they take Constitution damage: 1d4 for average doses, 1d6 and above for purer doses. This is because the magical energy that Deluge is providing is actually taken from their own souls and continued use will cause them to gradually wither away. It’s named Deluge because it feels like a flood of energy and power washes over you.",

 "Cyclops Tear: Taken by eating the powder. Causes your eyes to water a ludicrous amount. The tears produced are the main attraction of this drug.

To everyone else it tastes like tears. Overdose causes one of your eyes to desiccate and fall out. Oddly enough, people with only one eye anyway are immune to this effect, so it is very popular among Cyclopes.",
 "Goji Leaves: Originally created as a weapon of war, Goji Leaves (when taken in just about any form) give you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, advantage on all strength checks and saving throws, and rage damage equal to a barbarian of your level.

During this time, target will likely give up any info. After the pain, user feels intense pleasure for 1d4 hours, although this is less an effect of Agony and more of them appreciating their lack of pain.",
 "Yggdrasil Sap: A legendary drug that causes you to see into your future. This future is usually the users own death if they dont pass the DC 15 Constitution saving throw to not die from it.",
 "Weirdling Tea: a tea that shifts in color from orange to blue, when drank the user sees the effect of a roll on the wild magic table. (This is however just a hallucination)",

 "Top hat: a small top hat shaped consumable that melts on your tongue, soon enough you begin to see statistics on item weight, size, price, juice content, fuzzability, gloppiness...and perhaps some or all of these are just made up in you mind.",
 "Druidic Dream: A mostly benign pill made by druids and sold to whoever wishes to buy some. Its ingredients and manufacture are secrets the druids keep to themselves.

However, once the time is up the drinker must succeed a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw or gain a level of exhaustion. If the save fails by 5 or more, the drinker gains 2 levels.

 "Dreamer’s Fancy: A dark, shimmering liquid extracted from a rare root.

Upon lifting the vial to the characters nose and inhaling deeply, the user will be filled with an immense sense of power and will now be able to run, jump, swim, and lift up to 4 times as much as they previously could for 1 hour. In combat they may take an additional action once per battle. After 1 hour of usage, the user will feel sluggish and will have their senses dulled which will result in a disadvantage on perception and most strength based abilities for 4 hours or until completing a short rest.

 "Limit Remover: A highly expensive pill that after 2 hours of ingesting grants the user the ability to cast any number of spells without restrictions for 10 minutes according to the shady vendor. In actuality it is just a mint, a coat button, or something pull shaped that gives no benefit whatsoever.",
 "Faerie Food: There is a longstanding piece of wisdom, which says that you should never eat food offered to you by a faerie. This is absolutely true; in the Feywild, magic is so commonplace that cooking is considered its own school of magic, a mix of enchantment and illusion. Such food when eaten provides a taste that is far beyond anything a real tastebud could ever feel, and addiction is fast, difficult to resist and often lethal as mere mortal foods are not even considered food to an addict. Addiction is generally permanent, but can be cured slowly by a specialist who slowly drops the quality of food an addict ears until they can handle mortal foods again. Alternatively, if the food was eaten only once, a well-placed Modify Memory spell may cure the mental dependence.",
 "Faerie Dust: A very fine, iridescent powder, which is kept in a wax, sealed bottle, it is consumed by unsealing the bottle and very gently wafting the contents towards the nose with a DC 10 dexterity check, with failure resulting in an overdose. When correctly dosed, instills a gentle euphoria as senses sharpen and surroundings appear more vibrant, providing advantage on investigation and perception checks for one minute. When overdosed, the user experiences sensory overload, becoming confused for one minute. Faerie Dust, despite the generic name, is actually the collected breath of a faerie dragon. They find it hilarious that mortals can get high off their breath, and will happily provide the breath attack itself with only gentle coaxing. Some faerie dragons make their home in drug dens, exchanging their breath for a luxurious lifestyle and the opportunity to ply their pranks upon the many citizens of a mortal city. Some particularly daring patrons will pay handsomely for a high straight from the source, taking the breath attack of the faerie dragonhead on and inhaling deeply. The high provided is incredibly intense, and as a result such services are usually only offered with the recipient strapped down on a specially constructed bench.",
 "Shatter: A waxy, pale amber substance that can be smoked or consumed in a tincture. In lower doses it produces a pleasant high, but in higher doses (and for particularly sensitive individuals) it can cause a person to literally split in into multiple versions of themselves. If a PC consumes shatter and fails a saving throw, they are split into several nearly indistinguishable copies of themselves. A roll of 2 + 1d6 gives the number of shards. Okay, now for the catch: the characters stats must be distributed among the shards with no duplication, so the sum of the shards abilities is the same as the original character. Additionally, all of the shards have an aspect or condition representing their intoxicated state. After a period of time at GMs discretion, the shards will coalesce and merge again into the original character.",
 "Venge: a deep red powder of mineral origin that can be snorted for a euphoric and stimulant effect. If the character consuming it has any Berserker or Jekyll/Hyde like attributes, their Dark Side will come out 2-3 hours after ingestion, or if provoked. Even characters lacking such vulnerability, become belligerent and disagreeable after doing a line of Venge.",
 "Mummy Powder: though its true origin is unknown, the one thing thats certain is that it doesnt come from a mummy. When a sufficient quantity is consumed mixed with wine, it puts the drinker into a catatonic state for several hours. They experience a sensation of being transported elsewhere, into a vast unlit space. Cold cyclopean stones tile the floor and neither walls nor ceiling can be found. Many experience a presence, a monstrous and unspeakably ancient intellect with only one desire: escape from the dusty emptiness of this prison and into the fullness of the waking world. This being can and will barter various intangible goods: knowledge, memories, skills. However, it only has access to such things as it could previously have acquired from another mummy powder user. Furthermore, it will not give any knowledge directly pertaining to its own nature or the nature of mummy powder. Finally, before making such a transaction, characters are filled with a sense of dread and the knowledge that the being would only have carried out such a bargain if it brought the day of its escape nearer. This can be represented by a will save if the GM wants to emphasize the direness of the act.",
 "Forget Me Nots: These flowers grow in the wild, yellow in color. They can commonly be found in bright sunny climates. When consumed they apply a temporary new life. When consumed you believe you have a different life. If a lone wolf Assassin ate one he could very well believe he is a humble lumberjack with a small family in the countryside, at least for a couple of hours (1D4 hours)",
 "Fever Fire: Made from the petals of a translucent flower that grows even in the coldest and most barren environments.

 "Fates Hair: a flowering plant with long sinewy fibers much like hair inside the flower. When consumed you feel intense euphoria, and have a type of clairvoyance leading you to the next noteworthy encounter fate has planned for you- ahead of schedule. But, is it accurate or merely a hallucination?",

On a successful save you gain a great sense of confidence verging on recklessness and advantage on Strength checks for the next 10 min. On a failed save you still gain the features of a successful save but your INT score is reduced to 4 for the next 10 min.",
 "Stone Brew: A mixture containing what seem to be spiced-up brittle rocks. It hardens the skin of whoever drinks it, increasing their base AC by 1 for 1d6 hours.

Advantage on sight based perception, investigation, and insight checks.",
 "Warmroot: A small orange tinted root that on consumption, warms the body, a feeling very similar to being cozy in bed. All senses are slightly dulled. This was initially used for miners who worked in conditions of extreme cold, but was quickly discovered as highly addictive, warping the user into complete dependence on the drug. 3 Doses begins the addiction, with every week following a -1 being applied to all ability checks, stacks to five. They user does not have these effects for 2 hours after consumption.",
 "Drektheth Powder: Commonly referred as Dragon Dust. A golden powder with the same consistency of flour, the drug is overly bitter. After consumption, it makes the user feel much stronger than before, although no actual physical change takes place.

 "Droon: a potent, dull brown salve absorbed through ones pores, Droon greatly amplifies all sensations experienced by the body part, including proprioception. It can be an exhilarating or miserable experience, depending on how its used- a drooned-up hand marvels at the softness of silk, but might seize up and develop rashes as the temperature fluctuates. The localized enhanced proprioception can be disorienting for new users as well, but the euphoric sensations it grants are well worth it. Droon is rumored to be the refined toxic extract of a particular tall cactus.",
 "Ceruminal: a sparkling, faintly greenish wax originally sold as a decorative soap. A typical oral dose (about 12 grams) is enough to send an adult human of average weight into a pleasant mental fugue. Theyre incredibly disoriented during this time, often walking in elliptical loops, and when they eventually come down, all they remember is a sense of buoyancy and pleasant warmth. A rare few feel tiny sharp pounding at the top of their head, or dulled pain throughout their entire body. At lower doses, all it does is help clear sinuses.

However, the users sense of their own body is greatly diminished while under the effects of Raybark, so they might trip over their own feet, swing their arms into their sides while running, or fail to properly clench their fists as their fingers miss each other. Produced and used by a convent of hippie-like pacifists who enjoy feeling more connected to the world around them.",
 "Spiral: a flammable, forest-green liquid sold in small dropper jars, spiral is a fast-acting and addictive oral drug. A users sinuses and sense of balance are thrown out of whack as the drug begins to take hold, making them very dizzy. It simultaneously acts to dull pain and mute powerful sensory stimuli, giving advantage on any rolls that are dependent on resisting pain, blinding light, massive sounds, terrible stenches, etc. The dizzying effect makes rolls to keep ones feet or dodge harder, however. Spiral can be slowly burnt to produce a relatively large volume of smoke that has a diluted version of its effects. The smoke seems to be lethal to most insects, and those that dont immediately die drift around aimlessly until they do.",

They were extremely popular with children and adults alike before being removed from shelves due to delinquents recognizing their pure destructive abilities and utilizing said abilities in pranks that more often than not ended with the trigger-er in horrible pain.

While within you cannot interact with the outside world (cast spells or be heard, attack, etc. through it) but you can see and be seen vaguely through its curiously pink opacity. The sphere has immunity to all forms of damage and protects you from all forms of damage originating from outside the sphere. You are untargetable by sources outside the sphere. You may move at Speed -10 feet while within the sphere, rolling it along as part of your normal move. It is subject to gravity and will roll down slopes at increasing speeds (DM’s discretion whether falling is technically damage from outside or from your body colliding with the sphere). The sphere is linked to your person - if you teleport, ethereal jaunt, blink, etc. - it travels with you. The sphere contains 1d4-1 hours of breathable air within it.",

It requires an action to activate. Every creature (including the spinner of the top) in a 10ft radius must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned by the tops beauty. Any creature that enters the Tantalizing Tops radius while it is activated must immediately make the same Wisdom saving throw or become stunned.

Each 30 minutes of non-combat use, the user must make a Will Save (DC 10). On a failed save, user is paralyzed for 30 minutes. In combat, user gets one extra attack per Grabby Hand. Each time the Grabby Hands device is used to attack, user must make a Will Save. User declares at the start of their turn how many extra attacks they are making (up to a limit of 4). Each attack made raises the DC by 5. For a single extra attack, a Will Save (DC 5) must be made. For two extra attacks, the DC is 10, and so forth. On a failed save, user is paralyzed for one round.

 "Farbars Fantastically Fabulous Prosthetic Hand: Replaces your hand and part of your forearm. A prosthetic hand where each finger can be fired like a dart for 1d4 piercing damage (make an attack roll for each one). However, its activated by fully extending the arm, so dont extend your arm till you want to shoot.",
 "The Venomous-Spider-In-A-Glass-Orb Launcher! Just dont drop the ammo!",
 "Whirlypack: A large, heavy backpack with six differently colored ribbons attached. When you pull a particular ribbon, something happens. Red: A 3 metal pole extends upward from the backpack or, if already extended, retracts. Blue: Three large metal blades pop out from the pole or, if already unfurled, retract. Yellow: The blades start spinning. If pulled a second time, they speed up; a third time, they speed up even more; a fourth time, they slow down and eventually stop. Green: A series of small lights running up the pole illuminates; pull it again and they go out. Purple: A flashing light on top of the pole lights up and spins until it is pulled again. Orange: A siren blares. Unlike the other functions, the siren wails as long as the ribbon is pulled; it stops when you let it go. The intention is that the backpack will function like a helicopter. However, it doesnt provide enough lift, even if youre gnome-sized. Its more like a ceiling fan in a backpack, and to that end, it does provide a pleasant cooling breeze. The backpack is powered by lamp oil; one flask will allow it to run for a full minute. (The fuel tank is only large enough to accommodate one flask at a time.) When running, its quite loud and frequently belches foul-smelling black smoke. If properly employed while falling, the backpack will slow you down enough that you wont take damage, at least until it runs out of fuel (in effect it functions as per a Feather Fall spell). The spinning blades may prove troublesome to foes (and friends) in close combat. Obviously the ribbons are intended to be pulled in the correct order, but given there are no instructions or labels, most likely players will pull the wrong ribbon, which could lead to damaging the mechanism or worse -- for example, if you pull the Blue ribbon before the pole is extended, the blades will pop out, likely skewering whoever is wearing the backpack.",
 "Fireball Flamejet: A reinforced crystalline ball with a hole in one side and a tube protrusion on the other. When a fireball is cast into it, it spurts a jet of flame up to 1,200 feet away that does half the fireballs damage. However, it was only tested with low level casters so more powerful fireballs may cause it to shatter and have the fireball explode in place.",
 "Yuan-ti Finger Trap: If used by one creature: Fail a DC 13 Dex save (or voluntarily fail) to activate the finger trap by holding it between your two index fingers. Then succeed on a DC (20- Int Score) strength check to be able to escape. If another creature is proficient with int saves, they can use the help action to make the DC to escape equal 1. If used by 2 creatures: the enemy must make a DC 13 Dex save against being trapped. To escape, the winner must succeed on a contested Int check against the other creature. Every time you attempt the check and fail, add one more d20 of disadvantage.",

When blown, every creature of that type in a radius of 1 mile will hear the whistle and be bothered by it.",
 "A cup of infinite water. Or at least that was the idea. They just put a small portal to the elemental water plane on the bottom of a regular cup. Unfortunately, they did not think about water pressure, so anytime the (very securely attached lid) is removed, it immediately acts like a power fire hose. Make a strength check to open (the pressure keeps it very tight) and, if opened, make a strength or dexterity check to not go flying uncontrollably. You also have to make a strength check to close it.",
 "Wizzwalds Amazing Cube: This is a light cube made of brass approximately the size of 1/3rd foot by 1/3rd foot by 1/3rd foot. This cube effectively works as a spell magnet, if it is very close to the caster or target or between them, the spells will be redirected and absorbed by the amazing cube. The amazing cube technically has no limits on how many spells it can hold, but every time it absorbs a spell, there is a 10% chance (+ another 10% for every spell after the first it has absorbed) that it will expel ALL of the spells it absorbed in all 6 directions it’s faces are facing. This can lead to some incredibly chaotic results, such as shooting six fireballs out of all of its faces, and then flooding the area around it with water before shooting an eldritch blast at whatever targets are on the correct angles of the cube, or charming 4 separate creatures at once while also issuing a command creature spell making all of them drop their weapons. You can reduce the odds of the cube expelling its spells to 10% if you spend half an hour and expend a spell slot with it. However, any spells it absorbs after this will still add their bonus 10% chance.",
 "Henswallows Handy-dandy Healing Handcrank: This small metal box has a hand crank with a wooden knob and is designed to be laced onto a belt. Once per day you can use an action to turn the crank as fast as you can. Turning the crank emits the noise of ball bearings rolling in an empty can that can be clearly heard up to 60 feet away and soft, white light begins to escape from the seams of the device. Once the crank has been used, at the end of the users turn the wearer rolls 4d4. Odd numbers are subtracted from the wearers hit points and even numbers heal the wearer.",
 "Dodecahedron of Listless Wandering: Once activated this 20-sided sphere 1/3 Khelgars across in size will levitate and move in a random direction at 60ft per round. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by it, taking 6d6 crushing damage, and triggers a wild magic surge.",
 "Bouncy dynamite: It’s more fun to tinker then mine, but buying metals is a bit expensive. Maybe if we can get the dynamite to where it needs to be faster it will bring prices down. Just light and throw. Or go for the shock detonation version. Detonates in the, hmm, says on the box, an unknown number of hits, each stick is different, have fun discovering how many each need to detonate.",
 "Automatic Fire Starter: Tired of struggling to light your pipe or campfire with your clumsy mechanical piece?

 "The Jumping Spear: A two-handed spear specially made for smaller races with a spring-loaded spearpoint and footplants on the butt. At any point a small creature can jump on the footplants and slam down to cause the spear to explode violently forward with or without its wielder. Whenever a wielder uses this feature, they must make a check to remain holding the spear. However, on a success it does an extra die of damage on a hit, or alternatively propels the wielder up to 15ft into the air and 30ft horizontally. ——— It’s a pogo stick with a spear attached to it essentially.",
 "Landslide Module: 100lb drill attached to a clockwork mechanism with an explosive core. Once activated landslide module borrows into the earth in a random pattern (roll dice for direction?) dealing and taking damage until it explodes. Great for mining, demolition work or guerilla warfare.",
 "Punfkys Flying Machine: A glider made from spider silk. Enchanted to cast gust (a 30-mph wind if my math’s correct) 30 feet behind and under the glider. It... works, in the way everything works. Lets just say its not the most stable thing in the world.",
 "Gordexs Elevating Slippers, Lesser: The wearer of these rainbow-colored slippers may activate the slippers as a free action once daily. Upon activating these slippers, the wearer is instantly elevated vertically d6 ×10 feet into the air. During the ascent, the wearer may attempt to grab onto a ledge or any object they can reach as a DC 16 dexterity check. If the wearer has not grabbed onto anything at the end of the elevation, they begin plummeting to the ground and take falling damage as normal. Note: There are rumors that Goredex created a greater version of these slippers, but by all accounts, they were destroyed when Goredex impacted a moon.",

 "Havel’s Handy Hoppers: A bag of caltrops that bounce around like rubber balls once thrown.",

 "Traveler’s Survival Compass: This small metal cylinder shoots out a number of sawblades to harvest firewood from small trees. Subsequently it fires a gout of flames roughly the same direction to create an instant campfire. This handy tool also provides a sleeping solution, by spraying a large volume of quickly expanding foam for bedding, and it ensures safety at night by periodically sounding an alarm and flashing lights for the user to wake up and survey their surroundings. Gnome-corp is not responsible for any accidents involving faulty compasses and/or flammable bedding. The deluxe version comes with extra sawblades, scented flames, flavored bedding and a variety of alarm sounds and lullabies.",
 "Chillas Speed Sheath: If a blade is put in this sheath, a small tug will make an opening in the sheath and propel it forward making your initial attack much quicker. Good for surprise attack, unless you are not good enough to make the DC 15 Dex saving throw to prevent it from flying out of your hands or getting lodged into your body.",
 "The Boomstick: A large club with an opening on the bottom which is filled with explosives and a trigger on the top to make them go off. Just a shame that the club isn’t always sturdy enough to take the explosion, so its recommended the user wears some armor to protect them from surprise shrapnel. Oh, and make sure you can stand your ground, the recoil is terrible.",
 "The Excessively Thin Hat of Excessive Cool: It keeps the character cool in extreme heat, but if the temperature is any lower than extreme heat, the character starts suffering from extreme cold.",
 "Harrys Heating Gloves: Wearer can wear the gloves to heat up whatever they are holding. If powered on for too long the gloves melt onto the wearer’s hands.",
 "Gilgams Self-Replicating Rodent Remover: a tiny construct that pursues its designated target and removes it. If multiple targets are detected within its range, it will seek out materials to construct copies of itself. If in the course of locating said materials it finds other targets, then it will add those targets to its list while increasing the number of copies needed to cope with the added number of targets. The off switch is conveniently located on the roof of its mouth.",
 "Hellfire Sphere: A black sphere with a button on it. When the button is pressed, the sphere turns glowing red hot and melts through anything it touches. If not deactivated, it will eventually melt its way through any container holding it, and any surface it is placed on (including the ground). The button, which has to be pressed again to deactivate it, also melts anything it touches.",
 "Wind up Mimic: wind it up and set it down in a room, watch it transform into something inconspicuous. Oh, but make sure not to take your eyes off it or leave the room.",
 "Gloves of Burning: Only function if in contact with the user’s bare skin: on a successful melee unarmed attack wearing the gloves, everything in contact with the gloves takes 2d4 burning damage.",
 "Malputons Mechanical Mount: a bronze knee-high sphere with a small metal seat and a protruding yoke. Once mounted and started, the sphere wheels along the ground with a speed of 200 feet or quadruple the daily rate of a horse and rider. The seat is poorly stabilized, and the rider must make 10 Dex saving throws (DC 16) for each day of riding, or else fall from the mount and watch as it treadles into the horizon.",
 "Maviss Instant Malleable Metal: This small metal cylinder has as a plunger on one end that sticks tight to any piece of metal it is placed on. A DC 14 strength check is required to pry the cylinder off. When the command word is spoken, the cylinder casts Heat Metal on the metal it is stuck to until the command word is spoken again, at which point it becomes unstuck and falls off. Invaluable for any blacksmith on the go.",
 "Fizz-Sporks Sustenance Seeder: Wide nozzled rifle with a hose that connects to a large, seed holding backpack. A proprietary mix of seeds are stored in the backpack area, the portions only known to Fizz-spork himself. The user sprays seeds in an open field, in the shape of a pyramid to ensure correct sustenance portions. When done correctly, this will grow a perfect selection of crops, sure to last any village through the winter. Sadly Fizz-spork has been bribed by the local vegetable guilds. So, in reality, it only grows the most bland and rotten of fruits, sure to ruin fruits good name and drive customers to the vegetable guilds market.",
 "Spring-mallets Mice o Matic: A helm that is sombrero sized, made of brass and tin, etched to the glories of rodents past. Many wires protrude, sending off yellow sparks when in use. When a user dons this helm, they gain the ability to speak and read any mouses thoughts in a 100-yard radius. After a few hours of wearing the helm, a user can even start to control the minds of mice. Was designed to be a spying device, as the inventor dreamed of sending mind-controlled mouse spies into her rivals homes. Due to a lack of testing subjects (as of course, mice are the best lab rats, and they already speak mouse), the device merges the mind of the user and mice over time. Prolonged use may lead to the user having a strange desire to make bathroom in wood chips and have strong cravings for cheese.",
 "Radrey Zerz’s Pocket Transport: a four-inch by four-inch by one-inch box that unfolds into a small two wheeled vehicle with a T-shaped handle, propelled by the rider kicking off from one leg.

It achieves this by twisting the physical structure of the door on its axis, fast and in a violent way so the hinges are on the opposite side of the door arch.

The defensive mode lasts until it loses enough hp (again, up to the DM) or it recovers back to full health. It then returns to attack mode. The golem had five stages, each denoted by it losing a peice of armour after each defensive stage was ended by it taking damage rather than healing.

For example, for one round they may be a horde of smaller, weaker creatures, and on the next round they may fuse together to become a larger and stronger creature. The DM has a number of stat blocks prepared for creatures this boss can form, each of which has a minimum HP requirement to form. To make things more interesting, there may be stores of additional mass hidden around the battlefield, which the boss will attempt to reach to regenerate hit points and mass.

An intelligent and greedy sonofabitch, Kiirn sinks ships for their cargo which he then takes to his nest in a cove on a nearby island. The first stage of the fight takes place in the sea with players on a ship, which Kiirn is attempting to sink. The captain of the ship deems la d the only safe haven and heads for the nearest landmass, Kiirns island. Along the way Kiirn may become damaged enough to retreat, but the Captain insists on landing and repairing the damage. Otherwise, the ship becomes damaged enough and sets off on a crash course for the beach. The second stage of the fight is a scramble up the beach as an angered Kiirn attempts to kill the party and sailors. Players may stand and fight, attempt to rescue the sailors or flee. Kiirn is less concerned with the cargo than the people at this point. The third stage follows the retreat up the beach, a chase through the rainforest on the island. The players may chase Kiirn to finish him off as he leads them to his cove, or Kiirn may chase the players, angered by their defiance and the damage theyve done, or perhaps angered that they escaped him at the beach. The fourth stage is a fight in a large cave that leads to the cove. This is the point at which players and Kiirn alike are likely be exhausted and close to death. FINISH HIM. At each stage, Kiirn has a different objective which can vary based on the players actions. You can also spice it up with Kiirn having something akin to lair actions in each of the stages as well as environmental opportunities.",

At the start of each turn, “zone of irresistible dance” is cast through speakers that line the walls, which the Necro-dancer has the remote to. Each turn, the Necro dancer summons ‘backup dancer’ skeletons, or something that would be comparatively weak for the party’s level. This goes on until the song ends, at which point a giant disco ball is dropped from the ceiling with the intent to crush the players, taking advantage of the disadvantage dex throws and lowered movement. After that, the dancers stop being summoned, the zone of irresistible dance does not get cast again, and the Necro-dancer is left all alone. The song could also stop by breaking the speakers or remote, or escaping the dance floor.",

 "The One Who Is Many- Boss has 99 copies of himself. A mob attacks the party, all identical. Roll d100 every time the party attacks. The boss shares a portion of his life force with each copy- when his copies are attacked, he takes damage with resistance. When he is attacked, he takes damage with vulnerability.

 "A towering, ominous obelisk made of steel is guarded by 3-6 Animated Armors, 3-6 Flying Swords, and 1-3 Helmed Horrors. The obelisk is covered in glowing arcane sigils and scribbles that shine brighter when the players step forward to confront it, at which point the assorted defenders move to attack. The obelisk manifests a eye-like sigil which moves around its surface each turn to channel a beam that repairs and reanimates fallen defenders. This beam causes the target to regain 3d8 hit points as the components are magically regrown and imbued once more with magical energy, and is fired one time on each of the obelisks turns. Any destroyed constructs hit with the beam come back to life at 0 hit points and regain the amount rolled for the beam, though they cannot take their turn until the following round. To beat the obelisk boss, the invaders may attempt to attack a construct targeted by the eye beam while the ray is being channeled, which causes the amount of damage dealt to it to also go through to the arcane entity within the obelisk. The boss also takes 10 damage every time one of the arcane sigils or a significant part of a particular scribble is erased or damaged in some way, whether the marks are gashed deeply with a blade or blotted out with a destructive spell. The arcane entity within the obelisk has a total of 80 hit points, while the obelisk and the magical markings on it have an AC of 15. Destroying the obelisk entity makes it dissipate into the surrounding area without a trace, causing the arcane markings to go dark and all the constructs to fall apart, thereby ending the boss fight.",
 "Some amorphous creature that is under the permanent effect of a mirror image spell that refreshes after all images are dispersed (which could be flavored as overlapping images of the same figure, or many different figures, like nightmares, occupying the same space). The trick is to use area of effect spells, or somehow marking the real creature on a successful hit. For instance, striking the creature with a dagger tied to an immovable rod will pin down the real creature and prevent it from shifting around, rendering the mirror mages useless.",

It has an obscene amount of health and CON and cannot take damage from an attack that does less than 10 damage. A called attack to the head that does more than 30 damage or a grapple check followed by a DC 15 STR check will remove the armor’s helm from its shoulders, causing it to collapse. An arcana check will reveal that the armor is powered by a small gem on the inside of its forehead. A DC 19 slight of hand can remove the gem.",
 "An artificer that uses a set pool of arcane energy (lets say 100 mana) to power his magical armor and wand. He uses various spells, each of which take away mana. His magical armor prevents damage to himself at the cost of mana.

The Flesh Golems skin has seen a number of brutal battles, and has caused it to become torn which a poor slave has had to stitch up repeatedly after each battle. The Golem often bleeds from the stitches in combat ex-specially when the beast takes fire damage causing the creature to take disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn. The creature often leaves out a loud roar when burned by any source of fire damage. Whenever the Golems hit points fall below 50% (207/18D12+90), any fire damage that the Golem is dealt is also half and dealt to the Golems creator who is within 90 feet of the battle.",

The only way to damage it is by using spells/ bombs that affect both spaces at once, stealth attack it, or coordinate multiple attacks, so there are players waiting to strike as the cyclops teleports. Approximate CR is 7, one more than a normal cyclops, even though its stats are the same.",
 "A gargoyle with a big scratch on its neck. The gargoyles skin is tough rock, making it immune to all but psychic damage, unless the damage is applied to the tissue under the scratch. A character can make a CR 13 STR (athletics) check to keep it open the bruise for one turn, which becomes a CR 18 check if the gargoyle is airborne. Another character can step in to help, giving the strongest character advantage in the check. Approximate CR is 5, two more than a normal gargoyle.",

 "Whilst walking through through the run down boroughs of a large city you spy a strange exchange down one of the numerous labyrinthine alleys. A rather large and motley crow sits upon a busted crate. At the base of the crate an alley cat, accompanied by a scraggly litter of kittens, approaches the crow and drops what looks to be a shiny piece rubbish. You look on as both the cat and the crow seem to converse, the low cawing of the crow meeting the desperate meows of the cat. Eventually some sort of accord seems to be struck, and the crow produces a large half eaten fish, dragging it from the crate and letting it plop down on the dirty ground bellow. Immediately the mother alley cat picks up the fish and darts off, her kittens tumbling along behind her. Those who wish to stay and observe the crow for longer will discover that all manner of strays, ferals and other wild denizens of the alleys approach the crow throughout the day, including one or two beggars and street kids. Each time something shiny is produced, and an item from the box given. Sometimes food, sometimes junk, and at one point even a dagger (given to a street kid) is pulled from the crate. At sundown several more crows gather at the spot in the alley and begin to fuss around the crate. Eventually they all take flight, labouring under a sack clearly laden with goods. They cary the sack high above the roof tops, eventually disappearing from sight, their mysterious trade having officially closed for the day.",

You dont want a single pet, you want to adopt a whole family. Finally he gets to one animal and says Eh? This one looks good to you? Excellent! He then picks them up out of the cage, hands them to the person - again, regardless of whatever the person is saying - and then says Now there is just the little matter of payment .... Which is when the animal bites or claws the person and then gives the store owner a single drop of blood. Because he doesnt sell pets to people, he sells eople to pets");

However, the mixture introduced into the wearers body results in an equal penalty to INT, reducing the wearer to a drooling, beastly hulk.

While the mask is being worn by it’s bound owner, they are able to see through the covered eyes of the mask. The owner is able to detect a consciously made lie made in their presence, though lies made unknowingly and lies of omission are not detected in this way. If the bound owner asks a direct question to a single creature, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against a DC of 8 + the owner’s proficiency modifier + the owner’s Wisdom modifier or be compelled to truthfully answer the question to the best of their knowledge. In addition, the wearer of the mask is unable to knowingly speak a lie, directly or through omission.

That said, they receive an empowered darkvision that can pierce through even magical darkness, even if things can only be seen in black and white. Said darkvision extends out to 60 ft., but if the wearer possesses normal darkvision that extends farther, the effects will carry out to that distance. If the wearer of the mask attempts to look directly at anything emitting a light, they will suffer from temporary blindness that lasts for 15 to 30 seconds as a result. According to an old journal entry found with the mask, repeated attempts to look at light sources will increase the blindness time exponentially, to the point where the effect is permanent.",

Wearer can command the rope to attempt to grapple foes with advantage as a bonus action. Long term exposure to the mask causes 1d6 psychic damage per hour.

 "Beholder Sushi: Beauty may be in the eye of the Beholder, but it’s taste is in the eye stalks! Really speaking, this can be made with most Beholder-kin (such as Spectators) and even enjoyed as sashimi.

 "Gorgon Roast: While not technically edible itself, the rocky/metallic remains of a Gorgon Bull Male am excellent oven for the smart, open minded adventurer. Lighting a fire beneath an I damaged portion of the bill allows you to turn it into a giant cooling vessel. Always aim to remove the head cleanly for the best results.

It’s also rumoured to help the joints, especially after petrification.",
 "Phoenix Soup: Not made with actual Phoenix. This is made with a meat of your choice and a Phoenix feather. No fire necessary.

 "Manticore Skewers: Slightly dangerous. Never break the spines, and only ever use unbroken spines to begin with. Cut the manticore meat into bite sized pieces before skewering. Roast on an open fire. If the spine explodes, do not eat the meat. If prepared correctly, the spicy, fiery toxin will denature and become something akin to a sauce or marinade as it leaches out of the skewer and into the meat as it cooks. Not for the faint of heart.",
 "Dragon: A notoriously difficult meat. Dragons are normally sentient creatures, but the lesser dragons (including wyverns and wyrms) are considered fair game. Excluding the alchemical ingredients, such as the eyes or heart (which must always be consumed raw if used in magical recipes or rituals), most of a dragon is meat, just like any animal. After the arduous task of scaling (best done with the beasts own claws or teeth), the meat must be cooked on an incredibly hot flame, regardless of species. It is believed to be physically impossible to overlook dragon. Also, the dragons tongue is entirely edible. Often considered an alchemical ingredient, it can be cooked or dried into jerky. It often holds a little innate magic, transferring the knowledge of languages the creature knew in life, if any. An interesting (and tasty) way to learn some new words.",
 "Gryphon sirloin: Often utterly ruined by the casual adventurer, the Gryphon should be butchered by a professional whenever possible. A well prepared, fresh Gryphon sirloin will often fetch as much money as the party will receive from felling the beast in the first place! Surprisingly tender and flavourful, the meat is a strange combination of white and red, fusing the best of both into some of the best meat known to men or elves.",
 "Fried Goblin Ears: Works with a variety of ears, so long as the adventurer isn’t picky or is desperate. Favourite snacks of the bandit tribes of the south, the fried ears of their foes are enjoyed by all ages after the rest of the corpse has been robbed, stripped and butchered... maybe skip this recipe...",
 "Whole Roast Dire Boar: Wild pigs have nothing on the elusive Dire Boar. Even Dire Wolf packs think twice before attempting to bring down one of these colossal swine! Often as big as a small elephant, the only way to enjoy this is to roast it whole. Make it a celebration.

 "Kraken caviar: Incredibly rare and extremely expensive, only the richest of kings and emperors will ever be able to dine on the freshly laid eggs of a Kraken. These things are released en masse and grow rapidly to try and combat the multitude of oceanic predators that feed on their young. These must be caught and consumed less than 5 days after being laid. After that, if exposed to water, these regular looking roe will rapidly expand to the size of a cannonball and continue to absorb nearby water until it holds a pocket of water roughly 5ft in diameter.",
 "Hydra Eggs: With a similar property to their adult counterparts, the yolk of a hydra egg will appear to split up to 5 times while being beaten. If fried, the yolk turns a deep amber colour.",

 "Roast Behir: The only way to enjoy the multi-legged dragon lookalike. After removing the electric glands and other organs, the meat of a Behir should be either smoked or roasted. Most adventurers miss out on the best flavour of this mountain dwelling creature. Properly cooked, Behir meat should have a taste reminiscent of the air after a lightning storm. Pairs well with cheese, oddly enough.",
 "Ants on a Log: Raisins and peanut butter slathered on beholder eyestalks (replaces celery stalks).",

 "Fondgoo: An insane eccentric aspiring gourmet turned adventurer developed this after a horrific adventure in a ooze laboratory. Combining the jelly of a gelatinous cube with copious amounts of cheese and wine over high heat, you are able to neutralize most of the acidic elements to create an amazing dish. A mild anesthetizing effect tickles and numbs the mouth, preventing speech for a minute after consumption. Some consider this a boon and it is a frequent dish at many upper-class family reunions.",
 "Flesh Fondgoo: Captured by a human from beyond the stars with an unnatural hunger, the chef only had servitude as a survival option. Becoming comforter and preparer of meals, the new take on the fondgoo proved to be delectable with the right ingredients. Thin slices of half-orc proved to be the most popular with the star cannibal and his crew, wildly rich with only mild game flavor from the mixed heritage. The gourmet would never admit it to anyone, but his refined palate preferred the gnoll. The terror only ended after discovering what they thought was a holy grail, a Hungering Flesh that went from cornucopia to consumer in no short order.",
 "Roasted Phoenix: When youre done, you toss the bones in the fire and *pop* the phoenix is back. Also, you can always cook it just right; if you keep going, then it loops rare through well done.",
 "Forever Stew: made with a bit of troll meat which is still regenerating. If managed carefully, one only needs to add vegetables and can continue making a meaty stew night after night, indefinitely. But if you dont eat it fast enough or fail to tend it properly, you could end up with recognizable troll bits (hands, eyes, ...) starting to show up, or worse.",

This Dwarven dish has been since outlawed, with the discovery of the complexity of Flumph society. Although some still prepare it, as not only is it a delicious food, the psionic energy left on the meat brings joy to those who eat it.",
 "Neogi Neck: one of the few parts of the Neogi that are not poisonous, the Neogis neck has tender meat and takes months to spoil. As such, its often sought out by adventurers tired of eating the same old dried meat when on the road.",
 "Dry Stirge: this is a common folk food. In places with Stirge infestations, meat is often spoiled as these tiny creatures suck all of its blood and nutrients. Because of that, locals recur to it to replace their meat. The Stirge is prepared on a campfire, but because of the many types of blood that it sucks, it often leads to the eater contracting some sort of disease.",
 "Party meat: Nobody knows who had the terrifying idea of powdering sugar on Kruthik tissue, but certainly it was a madman. Or a genius, once you taste it and realise this abysmal combination is actually delicious. its almost impossible to attend to a dwarven party without seeing this dish, commonly known as party meat.",

 "Mind Flayer Calamari: Mind Flayer tentacles chopped and deep fried. Great with soy sauce and rice.",

 "Hydra Eye Jelly: A delicacy among the braver class of adventurers, Hydra eyes became so highly acclaimed in part due to the might of their owners, but also due to the fact that you will generally get a minimum of ten for every Hydra killed. Cook in simmering water until they begin to cloud, then chill in an ice bath and mash before mixing with pork gelatin and allowing to solidify while chilled.",
 "Froghemoth Calamari: Delicious and filling, Froghemoth Calamari is a dish enjoyed by all, cut into rings, removing the cartilaginous and muscular centre before washing well. To cook, broil until firm and serve with olive oil and vinegar or to simply fry until golden and serve with as many dipping sauces as you wish, dont be afraid to experiment.",
 "Pate of Elder Brain: A very difficult meat to acquire and tricky to prepare properly, Pate of Elder Brain is worth the work if you live to taste it. carefully remove all external tentacles and connective tissue before butchering, being careful of the internal connective tissue as you go. Cut into small pieces and place in a pot of water, slowly raise the temperature to medium until firm and blanch once cooked before blending. Ensure brain is really dead before preparing to butcher.",

Butcher the ribs down small enough to fit into your ceramic oven and cook overnight in your favourite pork sauce, before revelling in the delicious taste of possibly the most amazing ribs you will ever taste.",
 "Remorhaz Stew: Remorhaz is a wonderful meat for stews in that it retains heat forever! The Heat immune properties of the Remorhaz become fallible after their death, but they still require extremely high temperatures to be able to cook. Think smelting furnace, not oven. With such high temperatures required, Remorhaz needs to be cooked by eye due to the limited availability of such heat sources. Dice into evenly sized chunks and cook until very slightly crisp on the outside, tossing as you go before adding to a stew. Sufficiently heated Remorhaz meat will stay hot for hours, even up to a day or two, keeping any stew it is added to hot as long as you wish.",
 "Roasted Bulette Flank: Bulette flesh is damnably tough and needs to be slow cooked with extreme patience. Combine red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, brown sugar, mustard, rosemary, olive oil, and salt and pepper to taste to make a marinade. Cut the flank steaks off of the body and marinade them for at least a full day before roasting while continuously basting with the drippings. Once finished you will have a beautifully flavoursome and moist flank that while slightly gritty, is worth the effort of cooking it.",
 "Cave Fisher Sushi: As some of you may know, Cave Fisher blood ignites if exposed to flame or excess heat, therefore the best way to prepare it is to cut the meat into sushi sized pieces and drain as much blood as possible from the flesh before igniting and letting the excess blood burn off, lightly flaming the sushi for perfect preparation. Serve on Sushi rice with soy sauce.",
 "Forest Garbage Sauce: Anything you can use. Violet fungus, myconids, moss, mushrooms. Provides a hearty, earthy base. A secret: the sap of a treant, woad warrior, or blight is bitter. But together, simmer them. Put over any dark meat and find a bottle of dark, cheap red wine.",

 "Demon Wing Soup: Its very spicy, and the wings are chewy, but there isnt a whole lot for a humanoid to eat in hell, so it works.",
 "Candied Quipper: One of the cheapest quick snacks around. Quippers taste uncompromisingly bitter and have an awful crunch to them. They still arent very good once dipped in boiling tree sap, but at least they are covered in candy...",
 "Honeyed Sirens Tongue: The tongue of a siren produces the most wonderful sound when chewed, bards will often accompany instrumental performances with the chewing of a Sirens tongue in order to woo crowds even further. Mixing it with honey makes it slightly easier to chew, but cooking it causes it to lose these magical effects.",
 "Water Elemental Juice: The fluid harvested from a living water elemental has been known to retain effervescent properties after being harvested due to residual magic power left over in the collected sample. Water elemental juice can be mixed with anything from potions to fruit juice to make a refreshing bubbly beverage. It is suggested to not drink the substance without dilution.",
 "Pixie Salad: A tossed salad of finely chopped pixies will always produce the flavors of the colors of the rainbow. Each bite may taste like a different color, the first might be purple, the second may taste like red and so on and so forth. The older the salad is since the death of the pixies the closer the taste is to brown.",
 "Trollbalaya: A jambalaya made from troll sausage, typically with a drizzle of boiled troll blood, topped with two Trolls eyes. (Trolls are surprisingly delicious)",

 "Burritoes: Giants toes are surprisingly rich in protein and healthy fats. Chop them, Sear them, cook two behir eggs in the left over grease, and create an excellent set of breakfast burritos. For a bit of added fun, they are best served on the toe nail.",
 "Rib-hirs: Behirs are nasty buggers, but theyre good for one thing: ribs. The longest rib cage you will find, gather up your town, or the local goliath tribe, and youll make a killing off of these. Flay the scales and smoke at a low heat over hickory logs for 2 days, slowly rotating the ribs through. A nice baste of dwarven ale mixed with citrus, or a rub of an orcish spice blend will make this a meal to remember. Just keep in mind the smell will travel for miles, so you might attract a nearby Roc.",
 "Roc Stock & Balor: While not actually made with Balor flesh, this demonic delicacy is as the name implies a stew made from Roc stock and any sort of demonic flesh. Due to the hellish nature of the flesh, the stew does not need any outside heat to work itself to a hearty temperature. Good for thosein survivalist situations, assuming you can ignore the faint brimstone smell.");

 "One winter it was so cold that the dawn froze solid. The sun normally rose between two mountains, but the ice had built up so much that it stuck firmly in place. The first sunbeams of the day had frozen up like golden icicles. A ranger named Dav Oket was coming home from a successful night hunting with a fresh owlbear. Seeing the sun frozen in place, and being a smart man, Dav knew he had to do something quickly or the world would plunge into chaos. He swiftly sprinted up the frozen sunbeams and used the heat of the owlbear carcass to melt the ice. Dav gave the sun a kick to dislodge it, lit his pipe on the sun, and slid down the sunbeams with the owlbear right to his front door. He even kept a bit of the sunrise in his pocket to remember the occasion.",
 "If you travel to Owlbear Lake on a quiet day, you might just catch a glimpse of The Monster.

Some say it has hundreds of small legs that make it kind of skitter across the ground, but it can swim faster than a horse can gallop. Sometimes it sneaks up on swimmers, and if its not hungry it just pulls them under and lets them go. Of course old Dav Oket heard about this monster and bet his friends that he could take it on. After days of stalking, Dav finally had a shot with his bow. He was a crack shot, but not an arrow found its mark. The Monster scuttled forward and ate Davs bow! So the ranger wrapped his arms around the beast and wrestled with it. The fight was so great, so colossal, that it stirred up a storm over the lake. Finally, Dav threw the Monster over his shoulder, and it sailed right over the mountain. To this day, you can cross the lake in safety if you call out, Old Davs a-coming! and the Monster swims away to the bottom of the lake.",

 "Commoner’s Touch - A set of gloves that will turn all gold pieces they have touched into copper pieces for one hour. They turn back after the time has passed. A remove curse can dispel the effect.",
 "A string with a rock stuck to the end. The string is as strong as rope. When the string touches the rock they magically fuse and the connection is near impossible to break.",
 "Timed Immovable Rod - This immovable rod has a dial on each end. On one setting you twists the dial to have the immovable rod activate from between 1 to 10 seconds after you twist the dial. On the other you set the how long the immovable rod remains active with three settings 1 minute, 1 hour, and 1 day respectively. The Rod has a loop in the center to tie or hook an object or person to it.",
 "The Counting Eye - This small white marble colored like a human eye can be placed on any pile to measure a specific aspect of the pile, which will show up as floating red numbers projected from the pupil of the marble. You can ask how many of a specific thing is in the pile like number of gold coins in a pile of various coins, the overall weight of the entire pile, and the approximate worth of everything in the pile in gold pieces. Often used by smugglers to verify payment and that the goods delivered are not counterfeit. The marble has a 17 investigation score for determining if an object is counterfeit or not.",
 "Contraband Concealment Container - When this item is created the creator selects a material, spice, coin, or any other mundane material and a command word. The container has a seemingly endless source of whatever mundane object is selected, though it deteriorates from existence within a day of being removed from the container. When the command word is spoken and the container is opened, it reveals completely different contents. Stored in an extraplanar space, the container may store any amount that would make sense for the size of the container, and then by shutting the container, the bag will store the contents away until the command word is spoken again.",
 "The Discrete Dagger - When attuned to, this dagger shifts to the ethereal plane and becomes insubstantial for all other creatures other than the owner or ethereal creatures. As an action, it may be returned to the material plane and used normally. This dagger is a favorite among high profile assassins, as it cannot be found during a pat down.",
 "Dream Catcher - Very rare (requires attunement) - When a creature who speaks at least one language falls asleep with their head at least 10 feet from the Dream Catcher, if the user is on the same plane of existence and also asleep, they may enter that creatures dreams by making a successful Intelligence (Slight of Hand) check. Once inside the Dream, the user must pass an Intelligence (Stealth) check to stay undetected. They can make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to search and shape the dream to find the answer to one question. The DC of these checks is the creatures Intelligence score. The user may then leave the Dream or make a second Intelligence (Slight of Hand) check to repeat this process but this and all subsequent checks are made with disadvantage. If the user fails a check, they lose 1d4 Intelligence until dawn and must attempt the check again.",
 "The Ear Cuff of Attention - When worn, the ear cuff heats up whenever the wearer is being observed by a creature they are unaware of. The intensity of the warmth scales with the intensity of observation. (The stipulations keep party members from activating it constantly and keep it from going off at full strength every time someones eyes pass over them in a crowd.)",
 "A Get Out of Jail Free Card - An empyreal blessed card that only appears to be a simple rectangle card made of stock paper. For one use only, presenting this card to a guard will release the bearer from imprisonment. This card may be kept until needed or sold. (DC 25 Charisma check or according to DMs discretion)",
 "The Titan in the Shadow - A crown made of Ebony tipped with shards of obsidian. When attuned, the user can whisper its command word to grow one size (as they would under the effects of the enlarge spell) and become cloaked in shadows. While they are in this state, they can use the hide action to blend into the shadows cast by any object larger than they are (such as a building or a tree).",
 "Spry Skates - A pair of roller skates. Adds a +10 to speed when worn and allows the user to leave a creatures range as part of their movement without invoking an attack of opportunity as long as they did not start their movement inside the creatures range. Useful if you want to strike fast but stay out of harms way.",
 "The Firemans Friend - A small metal handheld canister that can silently cast the Control Flame Cantrip at will, but only the extinguish flames effect.",
 "Ariyi-Ino - An extremely lightweight +2 spear of elven design. When you twist the handle, it expands to a full sized pike and vice versa. Its lightweight design allows it to be used as a finesse weapon.",
 "A round, flat disk that, when thrown, will create a minor illusion to distract from looking at the thrower’s direction. The harder the rogue is able to throw the disk, the greater the distraction.",
 "A container of dark sludge that camouflages the wearer against the night sky.",
 "A living lock pick set that you have to pass a charisma check of 14 to convince it to pick a lock. If the roll is failed it becomes rude and angsty.",
 "Unassuming Box - This brown box made of an unknown and lightweight material has the odd property of being hard to pay any mind to, even in environments where it would stand out. Hiding inside of the box makes you nearly invisible when still. Moving while under the box makes no noise, but someone seeing the box move will make you automatically fails all Stealth checks. The box can be folded in order to fit inside a bag. Both folding and unfolding the box takes 5 minutes, each. For some reason, a large red ! is inscribed on the sides.",
 "A piece of paper that, when someone deads name is written on a line at the top, makes anyone who reads it thinks that it is the will/journal/letter/etc. of the name written. This effect wears off after 2 hours or when someone affected makes a successful Wisdom saving throw. The papers affects only work once, and stop having any effect on people after 10 hours past writing it or when the paper is destroyed.",
 "Glove of Rope Summoning - A thick leather glove with a hempen rope pattern etched into the back. Pointing at an object and speaking the command word causes a 50ft rope to launch from the glove and tie itself to the object. Once tied to an object the user can pull the object to them or use the ropeto climb up steep climbs. Any damage to the rope causes it to disappear");
$roomDescriptions=array("A crack in the ceiling above the middle of the north wall allows a trickle of water to flow down to the floor. The water pools near the base of the wall, and a rivulet runs along the wall an out into the hall. The water smells fresh.",
 "Thick cobwebs fill the corners of the room, and wisps of webbing hang from the ceiling and waver in a wind you can barely feel. One corner of the ceiling has a particularly large clot of webbing within which a goblin's bones are tangled.",
 "Tapestries decorate the walls of this room. Although they may once have been brilliant in hue, they now hang in graying tatters. Despite the damage of time and neglect, you can perceive once-grand images of wizards' towers, magical beasts, and symbols of spellcasting. The tapestry that is in the best condition bulges out weirdly, as though someone stands behind it (an armless statue of a female human spellcaster).",
 "Rats inside the room shriek when they hear the door open, then they run in all directions from a putrid corpse lying in the center of the floor. As these creatures crowd around the edges of the room, seeking to crawl through a hole in one corner, they fight one another. The stinking corpse in the middle of the room looks human, but the damage both time and the rats have wrought are enough to make determining its race by appearance an extremely difficult task at best.",
 "Neither light nor darkvision can penetrate the gloom in this chamber. An unnatural shade fills it, and the room's farthest reaches are barely visible. Near the room's center, you can just barely perceive a lump about the size of a human lying on the floor. (It might be a dead body, a pile of rags, or a sleeping monster that can take advantage of the room's darkness.) <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The darkness can come from a deeper darkness spell effect.",
 "Burning torches in iron sconces line the walls of this room, lighting it brilliantly. At the room's center lies a squat stone altar, its top covered in recently spilled blood. A channel in the altar funnels the blood down its side to the floor where it fills grooves in the floor that trace some kind of pattern or symbol around the altar. Unfortunately, you can't tell what it is from your vantage point.",
 "A liquid-filled pit extends to every wall of this chamber. The liquid lies about 10 feet below your feet and is so murky that you can't see its bottom. The room smells sour. A rope bridge extends from your door to the room's other exit.",
 "Fire crackles and pops in a small cooking fire set in the center of the room. The smoke from a burning rat on a spit curls up through a hole in the ceiling. Around the fire lie several fur blankets and a bag. It looks like someone camped here until not long ago, but then left in a hurry.",
 "A flurry of bats suddenly flaps through the doorway, their screeching barely audible as they careen past your heads. They flap past you into the rooms and halls beyond. The room from which they came seems barren at first glance.",
 "Rusting spikes line the walls and ceiling of this chamber. The dusty floor shows no sign that the walls move over it, but you can see the skeleton of some humanoid impaled on some wall spikes nearby.",
 "You open the door, and the reek of garbage assaults your nose. Looking inside, you see a pile of refuse and offal that nearly reaches the ceiling. In the ceiling above it is a small hole that is roughly as wide as two human hands. No doubt some city dweller high above disposes of his rubbish without ever thinking about where it goes.",
 "You open the door, and the room comes alive with light and music. A sourceless, warm glow suffuses the chamber, and a harp you cannot see plays soothing sounds. Unfortunately, the rest of the chamber isn't so inviting. The floor is strewn with the smashed remains of rotting furniture. It looks like the room once held a bed, a desk, a chest, and a chair.",
 "A skeleton dressed in moth-eaten garb lies before a large open chest in the rear of this chamber. The chest is empty, but you note two needles projecting from the now-open lock. Dust coats something sticky on the needles' points.",
 "Rounded green stones set in the floor form a snake's head that points in the direction of the doorway you stand in. The body of the snake flows back and toward the wall to go round about the room in ever smaller circles, creating a spiral pattern on the floor. Similar green-stone snakes wend along the walls, seemingly at random heights, and their long bodies make wave shapes.",
 "The manacles set into the walls of this room give you the distinct impression that it was used as a prison and torture chamber, although you can see no evidence of torture devices. One particularly large set of manacles -- big enough for an ogre -- have been broken open.",
 "You gaze into the room and hundreds of skulls gaze coldly back at you. They're set in niches in the walls in a checkerboard pattern, each skull bearing a half-melted candle on its head. The grinning bones stare vacantly into the room, which otherwise seems empty.",
 "Unlike the flagstone common throughout the dungeon, this room is walled and floored with black marble veined with white. The ceiling is similarly marbled, but the thick pillars that hold it up are white. A brown stain drips down one side of a nearby pillar. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The stain could be old blood.",
 "A huge iron cage lies on its side in this room, and its gate rests open on the floor. A broken chain lies under the door, and the cage is on a rotting corpse that looks to be a hobgoblin. Another corpse lies a short distance away from the cage. It lacks a head.",
 "This room is a tomb. Stone sarcophagi stand in five rows of three, each carved with the visage of a warrior lying in state. In their center, one sarcophagus stands taller than the rest. Held up by six squat pillars, its stone bears the carving of a beautiful woman who seems more asleep than dead. The carving of the warriors is skillful but seems perfunctory compared to the love a sculptor must have lavished upon the lifelike carving of the woman.",
 "A dim bluish light suffuses this chamber, its source obvious at a glance. Blue-glowing lichen and violet-glowing moss cling to the ceiling and spread across the floor. It even creeps down and up each wall, as if the colonies on the floor and ceiling are growing to meet each other. Their source seems to be a glowing, narrow crack in the ceiling, the extent of which you cannot gauge from your position. The air in the room smells fresh and damp.",
 "You open the door to confront a room of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling, and each hole is roughly a foot wide. The water pours in columns that fall through similar holes in the floor, flowing down to some unknown depth. Each of the eight pillars of water drops as much liquid as a stream in winter thaw. The floor is damp and looks slippery.",
 "This room smells strange, no doubt due to the weird sheets of black slime that drip from cracks in the ceiling and spread across the floor. The slime seeps from the shattered stone of the ceiling at a snails crawl, forming a mess of dangling walls of gook. As you watch, a bit of the stuff separates from a sheet and drops to the ground with a wet plop.",
 "This room is hung with hundreds of dusty tapestries. All show signs of wear: moth holes, scorch marks, dark stains, and the damage of years of neglect. They hang on all the walls and hang from the ceiling to brush against the floor, blocking your view of the rest of the room.",
 "You catch a whiff of the unmistakable metallic tang of blood as you open the door. The floor is covered with it, and splashes of blood spatter the walls. Some drops even reach the ceiling. It looks fresh, but you don't see any bodies or footprints leaving the chamber.",
 "Three low, oblong piles of rubble lie near the center of this small room. Each has a weapon jutting upright from one end -- a longsword, a spear, and a quarterstaff. The piles resemble cairns used to bury dead adventurers.",
 "Huge rusted metal blades jut out of cracks in the walls, and rusting spikes project down from the ceiling almost to the floor. This room may have once been trapped heavily, but someone triggered them, apparently without getting killed. The traps were never reset and now seem rusted in place.",
 "Several round pits lie in the floor of the room before you. Spaced roughly equally apart, each is about 15 feet in diameter and appears about 20 feet deep. A lattice of thick iron bars covers the top of each pit, and each lattice has a door of iron bars that can be lifted open. The pits smell of sweat and offal, but the room seems unoccupied.",
 "Many doors fill the room ahead. Doors of varied shape, size, and design are set in every wall and even the ceiling and floor. Barely a hand's width lies between one door and the next. All the doors but the one you entered by are shut, and many have obvious locks.",
 "A strange ceiling is the focal point of the room before you. It's honeycombed with hundreds of holes about as wide as your head. They seem to penetrate the ceiling to some height beyond a couple feet, but you can't be sure from your vantage point.",
 "This chamber was clearly smaller at one time, but something knocked down the wall that separated it from an adjacent room. Looking into that space, you see signs of another wall knocked over. It doesn't appear that anyone made an effort to clean up the rubble, but some paths through see more usage than others.",
 "A chill wind blows against you as you open the door. Beyond it, you see that the floor and ceiling are nothing but iron grates. Above and below the grates the walls extend up and down with no true ceiling or floor within your range of vision. It's as though the chamber is a bridge through the shaft of a great well. Standing on the edge of this shaft, you feel a chill wind pass down it and over your shoulder into the hall beyond.",
 "This room is shattered. A huge crevasse shears the chamber in half, and the ground and ceilings are tilted away from it. It's as though the room was gripped in two enormous hands and broken like a loaf of bread. Someone has torn a tall stone door from its hinges somewhere else in the dungeon and used it to bridge the 15-foot gap of the chasm between the two sides of the room. Whatever did that must have possessed tremendous strength because the door is huge, and the enormous hinges look bent and mangled.",
 "A pit yawns open before you just on the other side of the door's threshold. The entire floor of the room has fallen into a second room beneath it. Across the way you can spy a door in the wall now 15 feet off the rubble-strewn floor, and near the center of the room stands a thick column of mortared stone that appears to hold the spiral staircase that leads down to what was the lower level.",
 "As the door opens, it scrapes up frost from a floor covered in ice. The room before you looks like an ice cave. A tunnel wends its way through solid ice, and huge icicles and pillars of frozen water block your vision of its farthest reaches.",
 "A 30-foot-tall demonic idol dominates this room of black stone. The potbellied statue is made of red stone, and its grinning face holds what looks to be two large rubies in place of eyes. A fire burns merrily in a wide brazier the idol holds in its lap.",
 "Several exits lead from this room, but only one is within the mouth of a man. The door opposite you stands within an intricate stone carving of a man's wide-open mouth. The man's nose and eyes loom over the door while his sculpted hair splays out across the wall on either side.",
 "The door creaks open, which somewhat overshadows the sound of bubbling liquid. Before you is a room about which alchemists dream. Three tables bend beneath a clutter of bottles of liquid and connected glass piping. Several bookshelves stand nearby stuffed to overfilling with a jumble of books, jars, bottles, bags, and boxes. The alchemist who set this all up doesn't seem to be present, but a beaker of green fluid boils over a burner on one of the tables.",
 "The scent of earthy decay assaults your nose upon peering through the open door to this room. Smashed bookcases and their sundered contents litter the floor. Paper rots in mold-spotted heaps, and shattered wood grows white fungus.",
 "Several white marble busts that rest on white pillars dominate this room. Most appear to be male or female humans of middle age, but one clearly bears small horns projecting from its forehead and another is spread across the floor in a thousand pieces, leaving one pillar empty.",
 "A dozen statues stand or kneel in this room, and each one lacks a head and stands in a posture of action or defense. All are garbed for battle. It's difficult to tell for sure without their heads, but two appear to be dwarves, one might be an elf, six appear human, and the rest look like they might be orcs.",
 "A rusted portcullis stands just beyond the door. Looking into the room, you see three other exits, similarly blocked by portcullises. Four skeletons dressed in aged clothing and rusting armor lie on the floor in the room against the walls. They seem in poses of repose rather than violence.",
 "This tiny room holds a curious array of machinery. Winches and levers project from every wall, and chains with handles dangle from the ceiling. On a nearby wall, you note a pictogram of what looks like a scythe on a chain. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This room may be a control center for traps elsewhere in the dungeon.",
 "This narrow room at first appears to be a dead-end corridor, but then you note several metal plates on the walls set at about eye height. Looking more closely, you see that one of these plates is slid aside to reveal a peephole.",
 "You open the door to a scene of carnage. Two male humans, a male elf, and a female dwarf lie in drying pools of their blood. It seems that they might once have been wearing armor, except for the elf, who remains dressed in a blue robe. Clearly they lost some battle and victors stripped them of their valuables.",
 "The door in front of you seems to be stuck. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs yank it open, it comes open. Read the following: A furious rumble resounds in the area as stones come clattering through the doorway, along with a thick cloud of rock dust. The room beyond is filled with rubble.",
 "This chamber served as an armory for some group of creatures. Armor and weapon racks line the walls and rusty and broken weapons litter the floor. It hasn't been used in a long time, and all the useful weapons have been taken but for a single sword. Unlike the other weapons in the room, this one gleams untarnished in the light.",
 "There's a hiss as you open this door, and you smell a sour odor, like something rotten or fermented. Inside you see a small room lined with dusty shelves, crates, and barrels. It looks like someone once used this place as a larder, but it has been a long time since anyone came to retrieve food from it.",
 "A horrendous, overwhelming stench wafts from the room before you. Small cages containing small animals and large insects line the walls. Some of the creatures look sickly and alive but most are clearly dead. Their rotting corpses and the unclean cages no doubt result in the zoo's foul odor. A cat mews weakly from its cage, but the other creatures just silently shrink back into their filthy prisons.",
 "A cluster of low crates surrounds a barrel in the center of this chamber. Atop the barrel lies a stack of copper coins and two stacks of cards, one face up. Meanwhile, atop each crate rests a fan of five face-down playing cards. A thin layer of dust covers everything. Clearly someone meant to return to their game of cards.",
 "This chamber of well-laid stones holds a wide bas-relief of a pastoral scene. In it you see a mountain like Mount Waterdeep, except that Castle Waterdeep and the city are missing. Instead, a small fishing village is a short way from a walled complex with several tall towers.",
 "A stone throne stands on a foot-high circular dais in the center of this cold chamber. The throne and dais bear the simple adornments of patterns of crossed lines -- a pattern also employed around each door to the room.",
 "A wall that holds a seat with a hole in it is in this chamber. It's a privy! The noisome stench from the hole leads you to believe that the privy sees regular use.",
 "The burble of water reaches your ears after you open the door to this room. You see the source of the noise in the far wall: a large fountain artfully carved to look like a seashell with the figure of a seacat spewing clear water into its basin.",
 "This room holds six dry circular basins large enough to hold a man and a dry fountain at its center. All possess chipped carvings of merfolk and other sea creatures. It looks like this room once served some group of people as a bath.",
 "A glow escapes this room through its open doorways. The masonry between every stone emanates an unnatural orange radiance. Glancing quickly about the room, you note that each stone bears the carving of someone's name. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Consider putting the name of one of your party's characters on the wall.",
 "A huge stewpot hangs from a thick iron tripod over a crackling fire in the center of this chamber. A hole in the ceiling allows some of the smoke from the fire to escape, but much of it expands across the ceiling and rolls down to fill the room in a dark fog. Other details are difficult to make out, but some creature must be nearby, because it smells like a good soup is cooking.",
 "You've opened the door to a torture chamber. Several devices of degradation, pain, and death stand about the room, all of them showing signs of regular use. The wood of the rack is worn smooth by struggling bodies, and the iron maiden appears to be occupied by a corpse.",
 "This short hall leads to another door. On either side of the hall, niches are set into the wall within which stand clay urns. One of the urns has been shattered, and its contents have spilled onto its shelf and the floor. Amid the ash it held, you see blackened chunks of something that might be bone.",
 "Corpses and pieces of corpses hang from hooks that dangle from chains attached to thick iron rings. Most appear humanoid but a few of the body parts appear more monstrous. You don't see any heads, hands, or feet -- all seem to have been chopped or torn off. Neither do you see any guts in the horrible array, but several thick leather sacks hang from hooks in the walls, and they are suspiciously wet and the leather looks extremely taut -- as if it' under great strain.",
 "This small chamber seems divided into three parts. The first has several hooks on the walls from which hang dusty robes. An open curtain separates that space from the next, which has a dry basin set in the floor. Beyond that lies another parted curtain behind which you can see several straw mats in a semicircle pointing toward a statue of a dog-headed man. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The first part of the room may have been used for changing and cleaning feet before entering the room with the statue.",
 "When looking into this chamber, you're confronted by a thousand reflections of yourself looking back. Mirrored walls set at different angles fill the room. A path seems to wind through the mirrors, although you can't tell where it leads.",
 "A large forge squats against the far wall of this room, and coals glow dimly inside. Before the forge stands a wide block of iron with a heavy-looking hammer lying atop it, no doubt for use in pounding out shapes in hot metal. Other forge tools hang in racks nearby, and a barrel of water and bellows rest on the floor nearby.",
 "This chamber is clearly a prison. Small barred cells line the walls, leaving a 15-foot-wide pathway for a guard to walk. Channels run down either side of the path next to the cages, probably to allow the prisoners' waste to flow through the grates on the other side of the room. The cells appear empty but your vantage point doesn't allow you to see the full extent of them all.",
 "You push open the stone door to this room and note that the only other exit is a door made of wood. It and the table shoved against it are warped and swollen. Indeed, the table only barely deserves that description. Its surface is rippled into waves and one leg doesn't even touch the floor. The door shows signs of someone trying to chop through from the other side, but it looks like they gave up.",
 "This otherwise bare room has one distinguishing feature. The stone around one of the other doors has been pulled over its edges, as though the rock were as soft as clay and could be moved with fingers. The stone of the door and wall seems hastily molded together.",
 "You enter a small room and your steps echo. Looking about, you're uncertain why, but then a wall vanishes and reveals an enormous chamber. The wall was an illusion and whoever cast it must be nearby!",
 "You feel a sense of foreboding upon peering into this cavernous chamber. At its center lies a low heap of refuse, rubble, and bones atop which sit several huge broken eggshells. Judging by their shattered remains, the eggs were big enough to hold a crouching man, making you wonder how large -- and where -- the mother is.",
 "This small chamber is a bloody mess. The corpse of a minotaur lies on the floor, its belly carved out. The creature's innards are largely missing, and yet you detect no other wounds. Bloody, froglike footprints track away from the corpse and out an open door.",
 "A chill crawls up your spine and out over your skin as you look upon this room. The carvings on the wall are magnificent, a symphony in stonework -- but given the themes represented, it might be better described as a requiem. Scenes of death, both violent and peaceful, appear on every wall framed by grinning skeletons and ghoulish forms in ragged cloaks.",
 "A pungent, earthy odor greets you as you pull open the door and peer into this room. Mushrooms grow in clusters of hundreds all over the floor. Looking into the room is like looking down on a forest. Tall tangles of fungus resemble forested hills, the barren floor looks like a plain between the woods, and even a trickle of water and a puddle of water that pools in a low spot bears a resemblance to a river and lake, respectively.",
 "You pull open the door and hear the scrape of its opening echo throughout what must be a massive room. Peering inside, you see a vast cavern. Stalactites drip down from the ceiling in sharp points while flowstone makes strange shapes on the floor.",
 "You find this chamber lit dimly by guttering candles that squat in small hills of melted wax. The smell of their smoke hits your nose along with an odor that is reminiscent of the sea. Someone has taken a large amount of salt and drawn a broad circular symbol on the floor with the candles situated equidistantly around it. Atop the salt, someone traced the symbol with a black powder that glints a dull silver in the candlelight.",
 "This chamber holds one occupant: the statue of a male figure with elven features but the broad, muscular body of a hale human. It kneels on the floor as though fallen to that posture. Both its arms reach upward in supplication, and its face is a mask of grief. Two great feathered wings droop from its back, both sculpted to look broken. The statue is skillfully crafted.",
 "The door to this room swings open easily on well-oiled hinges. Beyond it you see that the chamber walls have been disguised by wood paneling, and the stone ceiling and floor are hidden by bright marble tiles. Several large and well-stuffed chairs are arranged about the room along with some small reading tables.",
 "Many small desks with high-backed chairs stand in three long rows in this room. Each desk has an inkwell, book stand, and a partially melted candle in a rusting tin candleholder. Everything is covered with dust. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The room could have been a scriptorium at some point.",
 "You round the corner to see a ghastly scene. A semitranslucent figure hangs in the air, studded with crossbow bolts and with blood pouring from every wound. It reaches toward you in a pleading gesture, points to the walls on either side of the room, and then vanishes. Once it has gone, you notice small holes in the walls, each just large enough for a bolt to pass through.",
 "You open the door and before you is a dragon's hoard of treasure. Coins cover every inch of the room, and jeweled objects of precious metal jut up from the money like glittering islands in a sea of gold. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> Taking one step in the room alerts the PCs to the disappointing truth. Their feet pass silently through the illusion of the coins to strike the solid floor beneath.",
 "You open the door to reveal a 10-foot-by-10-foot room with a floor studded with spikes. The bones of some creature lie among the spikes and some insects scuttle away from the desiccated remains. No other doors are in the room, and it appears the door you opened was created to blend in with the walls. Additionally, you see no ceiling. You must be at the bottom of a very deep spiked pit.",
 "You open the door to a long narrow room with a high ceiling. Three thick circles of wood rest on wooden stands. You're not certain what they are because you came into the room behind them. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> If the PCs step in the room to get a better look, they see that each is painted with concentric circles marred by dozens of cuts into its surface. They're targets, and the PCs are on the wrong end of an archery range.",
 "You open the door to what must be a combat training room. Rough fighting circles are scratched into the surface of the floor. Wooden fighting dummies stand waiting for someone to attack them. A few punching bags hang from the ceiling. There's something peculiar about it all though. Every dummy is stocky and each has a bedraggled piece of leather hanging from its head that could be a long mask or a beard.",
 "This small room contains several pieces of well-polished wood furniture. Eight ornate, high-backed chairs surround a long oval table, and a side table stands next to the far exit. All bear delicate carvings of various shapes. One bears carvings of skulls and bones, another is carved with shields and magic circles, and a third is carved with shapes like flames and lightning strokes. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The eight chairs represent the eight schools of magic.",
 "The strong, sour-sweet scent of vinegar assaults your nose as you enter this room. Sundered casks and broken bottle glass line the walls of this room. Clearly this was someone's wine cellar for a time. The shards of glass are somewhat dusty, and the spilled wine is nothing more than a sticky residue in some places. Only one small barrel remains unbroken amid the rubbish.",
 "Looking into this room, you note four pits in the floor. A wide square is nearest you, a triangular pit beyond it, and a little farther than both lie two circular pits. The room is rectangular nearest you but it widens into a larger rounded chamber starting just beyond the rectangular pit. You note that many flagstones, ceiling tiles, and wall blocks are carved with a skull emblem of some kind, whose dark openings emulate the layout of the pits. You've opened a door in the \"chin\" and are looking up at the face.",
 "This room looks like it was designed by drow. Rusted metal tiles create a huge mosaic of a spider in the floor, and someone set up rusted gratings like draperies of webs. At the far end of the chamber, the carving of a spider squats on the floor. It's about 3 feet tall and seems molded into the floor. Beyond it stands tall double doors of stone, their surface covered in a glittering web of gold.",
 "You peer through the open doorway into a broad, pillared hall. The columns of stone are carved as tree trunks and seem placed at random like trees in a forest. Stone root systems crawl out into the floor and marble branches expand across the ceiling. You even note a few carvings of small birds and squirrels. Beautiful as they are, the sculpting doesn't appear elven, and it's nothing dwarves would carve.",
 "This small room is lined with benchlike seats on all the walls. The seats all have holes in their top, like a privy. Facing stones on the front of the benches prevent you from seeing how deep the holes go. It looks like a communal bathroom. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> The PCs may have heard that these are common in Chessenta, but that country is hundreds of miles to the east and south.",
 "In the center of this large room lies a 30-foot-wide round pit, its edges lined with rusting iron spikes. About 5 feet away from the pit's edge stand several stone semicircular benches. The scent of sweat and blood lingers, which makes the pit's resemblance to a fighting pit or gladiatorial arena even stronger.",
 "This room is a small antechamber before two titanic bronze doors. Each stands 20 feet tall and is about 7 feet wide. The double doors are peaked at their centers, but unlike many sets of double doors, their division isn't in the center. Instead, the crack between the doors resembles a crooked bolt of lightning, which a figure in a cloud carved in the stone above the door appears to be hurling. The lightning bolt strikes down roughly 2 feet to the right of center. The figure in the clouds is deliberately indistinct, but it appears male, having a beard and male proportions. The stroke of bronze electricity hits a tower that seems small compared to the figure. This tower cracks down the center, continuing the gap between the doors until it reaches the ground. To either side of the tower lie pastoral scenes of hillsides dotted with sheep. There doesn't appear to be a lock or handles.",
 "You poke your head through the break in the wall and look upon a room of titanic size. It is clearly an enormous mausoleum built to the proportions of giants. Huge niches are set into the walls within which you can discern giant bones. Stern-looking statues of stone giants stand 20 feet tall against the walls, and in the center of the room lies a 15-foot-long sarcophagus.",
 "This chamber holds an odd contraption of metal and wood. It's a 20-foot-diameter circular platform that is tilted heavily to one side. Beneath it you can discern mechanisms that seem to attach to a large crank not far away. Above the platform hang metal weights on thin chains, which in turn are attached to discs and belts that are attached to other winches. It seems as though turning the winches turns and tilts the platform and sets the weights to moving. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> This could be a training room for combat, but the PCs don't see any weapons inside. Certainly it would take a great deal of concentration to fight on the platform; perhaps it's a training room for monks or spellcasters.",
 "You inhale a briny smell like the sea as you crack open the door to this chamber. Within you spy the source of the scent: a dark and still pool of brackish water within a low circular wall. Above it stands a strange statue of a lobster-headed and clawed woman. The statue is nearly 15 feet tall and holds the lobster claws crossed over its naked breasts.",
 "Stinking smoke wafts up from braziers made of skulls set around the edges of this room. The walls bear scratch marks and lines of soot that form crude pictures and what looks like words in some language [Goblin]. To the left lies a pile of rubbish and rubble heaped into a crude dais. The dais has upon it an ironbound chest that has been painted with a goblinlike face. Furs and skins of unknown origin are strewn haphazardly about the floor before the dais.",
 "This small bare chamber holds nothing but a large ironbound chest, which is big enough for a man to fit in and bears a heavy iron lock. The floor has a layer of undisturbed dust upon it.",
 "This hall is choked with corpses. The bodies of orcs and ogres lie in tangled heaps where they died, and the floor is sticky with dried blood. It looks like the orcs and ogres were fighting. Some side was the victor but you're not sure which one. The bodies are largely stripped of valuables, but a few broken weapons jut from the slain or lie discarded on the floor.",
 "You round the corner of the hall to confront a passage nearly blocked with crates, barrels, and chests. It seems someone set them up to barricade the hall. Three barrels are set up as seats near gaps in the barricade, no doubt the place where archers waited for foes. A rusting and torn breastplate hangs from a rope near the wall. <br/><br/>  <i>DM Note:</i> Perhaps the breastplate served as a warning gong.",
 "You smelled smoke as you moved down the hall, and rounding the corner into this room you see why. Every surface bears scorch marks and ash piles on the floor. The room reeks of fire and burnt flesh. Either a great battle happened here or the room bears some fire danger you cannot see for no flames light the room anymore.",
 "This hall stinks with the wet, pungent scent of mildew. Black mold grows in tangled veins across the walls and parts of the floor. Despite the smell, it looks like it might be safe to travel through. A path of stone clean of mold wends its way through the hallway.",
 "You open the door and a gout of flame rushes at your face. A wave of heat strikes you at the same time and light fills the hall. The room beyond the door is ablaze! An inferno engulfs the place, clinging to bare rock and burning without fuel.",
 "You peer into this room and spot the white orb of a skull lying on the floor. Suddenly a stone falls from the ceiling and smashes the skull to pieces. An instant later, another stone from the ceiling drops to strike the floor and shatter. You hear a low rumbling and cracking noise. <br/><br/> <i>DM Note:</i> The ceiling caves in during the next round.",
 "Dozens of dead, winged beings lie scattered about the floor, each about the size of a cat. Their broken bodies are batlike and buglike at the same time. Each had two sets of bat wings, a long nose like a mosquito, and six legs, but many were split in half or had limbs or wings lopped off. Their forms are little more than dried husks now, and there's no sign of what killed them.");

There are plates of food on tables, still warm. Clothes on a washing line are still damp. Only the doors into the mill are locked. As night falls, a fierce storm begins to build, and from the mill the saws can be heard rasping back and forth, though they don’t sound quite right…",
 "The party finds a scraggly, disheveled child apparently lost in the forest. It asks the party for help, should the party agree, they come under the effects of a curse until they defeat the child (Actually a restless Evil) who flees, attempting to lead them into a hazard deeper in the forest.",
 "Small dolls sit in a tree the players pass by. They are wearing crude clothes, and don sticks of specific lengths. Poor perception rolls feel anonymous sets of eyes gazing at you, while good perception rolls can discover them. These dolls, if ignored, will appear again in a different tree a few feet up, requiring lower rolls as they subtly make themselves more obvious. Upon the first investigation, you find that the dolls are poorly stitched together, with leaves still poking out of the burlap fabric, and expressionless faces with small stones as eyes. However, with each successive perception roll as the party walks away, the dolls become slightly more realistic. On additional rolls their rock-eyes appear to follow you (Mona Lisa style), their skin becomes taut and leathery, and their clothes become more realistic. Repeat as necessary, with the players unable to leave a small section of the forest (due to magical barriers, or because walking straight forward keeps leading them back to the same spots.) Eventually, all of the dolls should clearly resemble everyone in the party. It is important that the dolls never appear to move on their own, and in every way act as though an inanimate object would. They can be destroyed, ripped, held, carried, etc. There should also be at least 4 separate perception checks on the dolls IMO. It really draws the frustration out, and that is an expression of fear. The final perception check on the dolls will have the dolls be very hard to find, except by one person, who you can choose beforehand. No matter how well other party members roll, the person you choose will feel a tingling on the back of their neck, and turn around to find the dolls in a high branch. They are nearly perfect mimics of the party, and are standing around the doll that looks like the person who discovered them, whose doll has a thick piece of string around their neck. The person feels paralyzed as the can only just watch due to fear, as time slows around them. The doll-party gazes directly into the player characters real eyes, and gently… pushes. For extra effect, have a pencil ready to snap upon this moment. Sometimes the cheesy sound effect speaks volumes more than words. The party will usually react at this point, let them destroy the dolls. It’s cathartic. If you want to continue the fear though, every one in a while later on, let them see a flicker of movement out of the corner of their eyes. Bonus points if you pick a grunge or mistake to build this off of. Like if a cleric forgets to heal a fighter and the fighter calls, have one of them be the one that pushes the other off, as though the cleric purposely didn’t heal, or the fighter was trying to get revenge. If the party has a rogue, have their doll slip a stick in the back of the hanged on. There’s a ton of customization you can do, and if done well, you can seed a lot of discord between two player characters and build their relationship to be really dynamic. Happy Creepy Crawlies.",

 "As the party sets down for camp they hear a muttering in the shrubs and then creeping out from it they behold a Gibbering Mouther, each eye and mouth seemingly drawn from a different creature, without repetition.

As you review the scene, the trail behind you vanishes and leaves naught but deep and ancient thorn bushes, redolent with the faint reek of decaying flesh.",
 "A medium sized hut made of gingerbread and various pieces of candy. A kindly old woman asks you in for dinner.",
 "A pile of shit with human clothes, hair and bones in.",
 "The party find a clearing with an odd nature alter in the center. While they are distracted, the trees around them move closer. If they are distracted for long enough, the trees form a complete wall. The trees do not attack; they only defend themselves if attacked.",
 "There is a tree with deep scratches in it, as if it has been attacked by a dagger. Upon inspection, the player discovers old, dried blood embedded in the bark and writing in a deep red color that says ‘Find me, help me’ (illusory script). As the party continues they see more trees of a similar nature, and eventually find a crazed gnome who is determined to eat party members in order to restore his youth.",
 "The path opens into a clearing. Near the center is a unicorn lying down on its side. It looks serene and peaceful. The clearing is bright and quiet. Almost silent but for distant birdsong. If the party approach they realize it is dying. Its throat is torn open by some powerful beast and the wound looks infected or poisoned. The edges of the clearing are creeping in, going brown or fungus laden and choked with weeds and branches, which seem to close in whenever no one is looking in that direction. The unicorn is probably (?) past any help the party can give but may last an hour. Left to its own devices, the clearing will close in maybe 20 minutes.",
 "The trees appear to be leaning closer together and are a different shade of green to normal trees. As a breeze blows they seem to be whispering to each other wisha…wisha…wisha",
 "The undergrowth is thick confining you to a narrow path. It switched sharply left then right…. to a dead end. Turning back it is a dead end that way. The only way forward is to hack through the lower branches and scrub. As the players do, the cut stems ooze blood. If burned instead the wet plants hiss and whistle as they burn sounding like tortured screams.",
 "You begin to notice that everything looks familiar. Slowly it dawns on you that the trees are all identical, right down to that twig that snapped off when it caught on you backpack.",
 "A family of forest giants has caught the scent of the party while hunting. They’re catching up.",
 "Disembodied screams echo around you. Ghosts of the past? Or maybe it’s Jim the halfling rogue, trying to scare off tourists so he can start a coalmine?",
 "In the distance you see a light. When you get closer you see a lamp hanging from a tree swinging in the wind. It is full of oil but there are no signs of whoever put the lamp there.",
 "You find humanoid skeletons tied together to form the rough shape of a horse. If you use speak with dead on it, it only screams.",
 "You suddenly realize that all the noise in the forest is gone. As if silence had been cast but you can still talk and make noise as normal. Suddenly the forest is filled with howls, screeches, and buzzing so loud it deafens the party. When the party can hear again the forest is back to normal.",
 "You come across a cottage in the woods belonging to a friendly woodsman and his wife. They provide food and shelter for the night. When the party awakes they are in the burned down ruins of a cottage with the skeletal remains of the farmer and his wife reaching desperately for the party.",
 "A hooded figure sits on a stump. He does not respond to anything. If you attack or touch the figure they collapse into a swarm of spiders.",
 "A parrot is found on a branch repeating the words ‘Gods what is that?!’",
 "The party finds a wanted poster tacked to a tree with a group shot of the party with a red X marked through two of the party members faces. The party does not remember posing for this picture nor know why they would be wanted.",
 "You come upon a dry riverbed. From the trees lining the banks dangle a hundred mutilated corpses.",
 "Two children play fight with sticks, laughing and taunting each other. When they notice the party watching, they’ll happily put on a show. That’s when the other children emerge from the trees, only they aren’t playing and they’ve got more than just sticks and stones.",
 "A strangely inviting cave comes in to view. Surely it’s some kind of den and we shouldn’t go in but I just… cant…. help it.",
 "From deep within the forest loud clicking and chattering noises of various pitches and tempo can be heard. Upon inspection a small city raiding party dressed in armor have been brutally mutilated with heads twisted round and limbs ripped off. The same clicking noise starts again and gets closer and louder. When it seems like the creature is on top of them it suddenly stops and does not reappear.",
 "It has been at least 24 hours since sunset and it has yet to come back up. What’s worse is that all the forest chatter from insects and wildlife has trickled nearly to a standstill save for one slow but consistent crunching that has been following at a distance for hours now. Are the stars even moving anymore?",
 "Early in the day the party passes underneath a suit of armor suspended in the trees, branches occupying the inside of the suit as if they had squeezed out the body that occupied it before. Branches sprout from the facemask wildly, limbs protrude from the leg and armholes, and the entire chest piece is nearly bursting from the volume of foliage it contains.",
 "Just when its time to make camp for the night yet again within the damp cold forest, the party comes across an old house sitting unoccupied in a small clearing. They seek comfort in the house, building a fire in the hearth and drinking some old booze left by previous tenants. Keeping good watch, they peer out the windows frequently. Maybe it’s just the old wine but are the trees…. getting closer?",
 "A few chickens are pecking at the dirt in the middle of the trail. When you come upon them, you spook them, and they trot off into the forest a few meters. They resume pecking; but little does anyone know that they’ve begun to peck seeds that have the effect of the enlarge spell. Treat an enlarged chicken as an allosaurus and let the fun begin.",
 "Glowing eyes stare out of a knothole in an old and gnarled tree. When the players notice it watching, the thing scampers deeper into the tree. If they investigate the knothole they’ll find it goes deep, deeper than the tree itself. At the bottom of the hole something glitters. Gold? Many more glowing eyes stare up around it.",
 "A corpse sways in the branches of a lonely willow by a stream, dangling from a noose. The corpse is grinning, and dancing a slow, merry jig.",
 "Something howls in the distance. Another something responds. Not wolves. The howls are too ragged, sound too much like words.",
 "A little twig-and-twine doll is pinned to a branch up ahead. Another just like it can be seen just off the path, and another beyond that one. Even in the depths of the woods you’ll be protected so long as you follow them. Your safety once you arrive where they’re leading you is less guaranteed. A polite invitation has been extended. It won’t come again.",
 "Moaning can be heard from a bush. Within is a hunter, near-death, near incoherent from fear. No mere animal could have inflicted the wounds he bears. They’re too precise, suggestive of strange symbols.",
 "The trees in this part of the forest are all wrong. They’re growing in neat rows; they sway though there is no wind. Strange fruits swell in their boughs. You’ve stumbled into an orchard. Were those stones you stepped over a ways back someone’s fence?",
 "A boar bursts out of the undergrowth; foaming spittle flecks its tusks. It charges, eyes bloodshot, but makes no move to defend itself. All its attacks seem half-hearted. What drove this beast to seek death so?",
 "Cloying mist drifts into the region. You can barely see five paces ahead of you. Vague, bulbous forms can be seen protruding from the trees as you pass. Fungus. This isn’t mist, it’s spores.",
 "A fire shines through the trunks a little ways from you. Around it are adventurers, like you, camping for the night. None of them speak the same languages as you. The forest has them spooked, paranoid. They’ll welcome familiar company at first, but any number of things you do could set them off.",
 "A pond in a clearing, clean and still. No animal drinks from it, no insects buzz above it. No monsters will approach here beyond the tree line. Is it safe for you to stay here?",
 "The forest path is narrow and overgrown. Looking down the tunnel-like trail gives you vertigo and puts you off balance. Shadows appear to move and you feel like you’re just going in circles.",
 "The forest itself seems to be against your presence. Roots seem to spring up to trip you and branches swat at you when moved out of the way. The canopy closes around you shutting out the sunlight.",
 "The players hear footsteps echoing theirs, slightly behind, but the path is empty. Anything they call out is repeated back with missing syllables, as if the voice is in pain.",
 "A child’s laughter is heard off of the path, along with a flicker of light, which keeps appearing further away if the party follows. It leads them to the body of an elven boy with an arrow in his back.",
 "One member of the party hears the creaking of the trees and sounds of the forest suddenly stop, then a voice right behind them whispers their name on a hoarse voice, but there is no one there. None of the others notice anything different.",
 "The players hear the sounds of cries and screams from soldiers and the guttural cries of a nightmarish creature echo through the forest. The last one goes quiet before they reach them. If they choose to search, they find scattered around the ground the weather-worn skeletal remains of 16 soldiers from a long-dead empire known for it’s brutal methods, some of which are found ripped apart apparently trying to flee.",
 "The players feel as though something is watching them, but can’t see anything in the darkness. If they move more than 30ft in any direction they hear rustling following, but no matter how much they search cannot find anything.",
 "A dead character from one of the character’s past stands amongst the trees, with the appearance and wounds they had when they died. Only one person can see them. The character doesn’t move, but silently watches the player. Any attacks go through them without causing damage. They dissolve into a smoke-like darkness after 1d6 minutes.",
 "The sound of whispering is heard behind a bush. When it is pulled back or someone moves behind it, the whispering stops abruptly and a darkened feather falls slowly to the ground.",
 "A group of little girls are tied to the trees just off of the path, crying quietly. If the party goes to rescue them, they fight being rescued and attempt to escape and retie themselves to the trees, warning that ‘the Grogleman’ will come for them and their families too if they return home.",
 "A group of giants sit motionless around a giant chessboard, eyes intent on the pieces. Closer examination reveals the three are corpses; fungi grow from their eyelids and out of their hair, and the bodies slump and collapse if touched.",
 "The ground on both sides of the trail seems odd; upon closer examination, it is absolutely swarming with termites, covering the whole ground like a wave. If the party steps off the trail, the insects scatter from the party’s feet, leaving strange, momentary footprints in the ground.",
 "Prayers cannot be uttered aloud in the forest; spells can be cast as normal, but any verbal component comes out as a rattling hiss.",
 "A thick fog hovers over the ground, reaching up about two feet (to the chests of any halflings in the party, to the knees of humans). Anyone putting their heads in the fog (bending down to pick something up, etc.) hears muffled screams and far-off voices begging for their lives.",
 "Each person awakes to find a large meat hook carefully placed along on their bedrolls over their stomachs.",
 "In the periphery of the party’s vision, the trees that they pass seem to take on the image of a grim army, marching next to the party. When faced directly, the trees seem rather normal. The whole forest smells like a battlefield.",
 "Every time anyone lights a fire in the forest, there is a sudden hissing and smoking from the ground for twenty feet around the sparks. Little red lines appear like veins in the earth before fading to blackness.",
 "A monkey in a Jester’s costume comes swinging through the trees, hooting and screeching. If the adventurers catch the monkey, they find a bloody knife stuck in its belt. The monkey stares at them all with a baleful expression.",
 "Crows are screaming at each other as the party enters the woods. Increasingly, the screams sound like words, demanding blood.",
 "The hedge on the side of the trail has strange burn marks in it, almost exactly in the shape of men.",
 "A fox with a bloodied and broken leg comes limping up the path to the party and will pass by it if it can. If anyone speaks to it, the fox changes form into an old druidic woman, who mumbles about the forest being unsalvageable.",
 "As the party walks into the forest, they are greeted by an adventuring group coming the opposite direction. They chat for a little bit, explaining they found the woods too dangerous and are making their way back to whatever town the party has just come from. A little farther into the woods, the party finds the corpses of the same adventuring group, gathered around the sputtering embers of a fire…",
 "A bucket has been nailed to a tree, with a crude sign saying ‘Donations’ hanging under it. The bucket is half-filled with fingers and toes in varying levels of freshness.",
 "A small, neat signboard reads, ‘Please remain on the path.’ The neatness is somewhat marred by the corpses strewn below the sign.",
 "Someone has sharpened the branches around the trail in the forest, so that the trail is surrounded by sharp points.",
 "The party finds themselves staring at a strange tableaux- the corpse of a squirrel is placed next to an acorn, followed by (in order) the corpse of a cat, a dog, a wolf, and a bear. Behind the bear are strange scuffmarks in the dirt, like there was another corpse behind it, this one in the shape of something human…",
 "As the party walks through the forest, a strange figure suddenly drops from the trees in front of them- upon inspection, it is an effigy in the rough shape of a man, made of wooden boughs and leaves. This happens twice more as they walk. The fourth time, the figure drops down again, but anyone going to clear it away finds that it is actually the corpse of a man this time, with branches lashed to his limbs and a grisly smile on his face…",
 "A cold mist creeps into the surrounding area, players who breathe it will be asked to make a roll (perception, nature, etc.) but they’re making a constitution save with whatever modifier from the false roll. Anyone who rolls above a set DC inhales the mist and is subject to strange illusions.",
 "A hanged man rests on a lone tree. His pockets lined with petty change and a note that appears to be an apology letter to his family.",
 "For an hour of travel there’s no sound other than the party.",
 "A section of the forest has been frosted over in what appears to be a permanent winter. The center appears to have an unnatural cave of rocks that don’t match anything of the surrounding geological features. Inside features a drop that appears to be without end.",
 "A small portal opens up about 15 ft. above the party, expelling a blood lusted demon to the ground below. It bounces, stunned momentarily before it acquires a new target.",
 "A large head-sized knot in a tree resembles a human face. Wait! The eyes are real: wide, staring, terrified eyes! They look at you as you approach, flicking to each person that talks. But they cannot blink (so cannot communicate in that way), but constantly weep a watery sap.",
 "A large open area. The dirt seems fresher than the rest, no grass growing on the surface. The trees around the edge of the grove are burnt. In the middle sits (1d4) huge skulls, each at least 5 times the height of an average human. These skulls have gashes and claw marks in them, as well as huge spiraling or pointed horns. Scratched into the largest one is ‘entrance’ in infernal. If the player puts their ear to the ground and listens, they can faintly hear a low rumble that unnerves them to their very core and they don’t know why. Digging downwards could potentially reveal a connection between the material plain and one of the evil-aligned outer plains.",
 "The first character to awaken sees a grotesquely exaggerated face hovering inches from their own, glowing weakly with an internal light. An ear-to-ear grin splits the face, revealing a maw with three rows of serrated teeth. When the character blinks, the face disappears. It never appears again.",
 "The party comes across perfectly circle clearing. It’s barren waste, nothing ever grows there. Any flora the party might bring with them instantly wilts as it crosses the border. No animal, even as faithful as ranger’s companions, can be forced to cross into that circle. If the party decides to spend a night there, they will wake up outside the circle, with all their things scattered across the outer rim of the clearing. If they do it on the night of winter solstice, they will wake up in Avernus instead.",
 "The trees suddenly grow until the sun is blocked out and a magical darkness is cast from somewhere, and whenever the players talk, they hear their words repeated to them in their voice, but can’t tell where it’s coming from.",
 "The players slowly realize that they are on a loop in the forest. Every night they make camp, then wake up with supplies returned and make the exact same journey again. The players must find the source of this curse and free themselves.",
 "While the party makes camp, someone notices that there is an additional person around the fire. How did no one notice? Why does it smell like rotten meat? And why is it looking at the barbarian like that?",
 "In a less dense part of the forest, where moonlight pours through, the party witnesses a strange hulking creature (Mothman) perched on a tall tree. Its giant red eyes watch the party for a moment, before the creature flies away. The party sees the creature a few more times before coming to a large bridge built over a dangerous river. The creature appears one more time over head, just as the bridge collapses.",
 "After camping in the woods the party awakens to find the trees around them whipping and lashing as if buffeted by strong winds, though the party feels not even a faint breeze. Upon closer inspection, the party notices in mounting horror that the shadows cast by the trees are in the shape of human beings writhing in silent agony.",
 "The party comes across a 50ft circle of pitch-black darkness, with no logical reason as to its existence. Any players that cannot see when in such conditions hear whispers and chattering while in this area, and take 1d6 slashing damage for every round spent there. Any players that can see in such conditions (ex. darkvision) will not suffer any of these effects, and will see that nothing is attacking the others, but rather the wounds are manifesting onto them.",
 "You see corpses pinned to the sharpened boughs and branches of the tress around you, wood puncturing through their throats and sternums. The mottled moonlight filtering through the slowly swaying leaves gives them an eerie sense of motion. A sudden scampering and swish of branches punches through the soft rustling of the trees. Wherever you turn, the sound seems to be coming from behind you, getting closer and closer till you feel a hot, wet breath on the back of your neck. You swing around to confront the horror and see nothing but the corpses in the canopy, leering down at you like demonic piñatas.",
 "The party stumbles upon a clearing, with a post stamped into the ground. A message scrawled in Primordial reads about a treasure found in the hidden home of squirrels. With a few investigation checks, the party finds an odd tree. Around the back of the tree is a poorly hidden, though hidden, door. The door has no lock on it, but is not open; it has a feeling as though it is stuck. It can be forced open, or pried open, or cut open with fairly decent resistance. Inside is a staircase leading downward, lit by candles embedded in the tree that don’t seem like they’re burning the tree, though they are quite bright. After a 5-minute descent, the staircase ends in what appears to be a basement. The ceilings drip, and the room is damp and warm. (You can also narrate that the stairs are slippery, and have your players roll athletics not to slip). A decent perception roll can see that the floor and ceiling leak the warm water, without much of a source, while a really good perception check will notice that the color of the environment has become darker, and has a reddish tinge. Otherwise, there appears to be a library or study (whichever is easier for you to narrate.) There are no loose papers or pens and all of the books appear to be locked up, so that they cannot be taken out. A chest in the back can be found, a hair too conspicuously. Upon opening it, there is nothing inside but a pit, that smells of vomit and acid. With that, the room begins to shrink, slowly. The party should discover that they’re in the mouth of a giant mimic, who is swallowing them. Upon escaping, the entire tree uproots itself, spits and snarls at the players, and runs away. Best described if you can drop hints about descending the gullet of a beast, such as a hot draft, or distant gurgling.",
 "The party makes camp, and partway through the night, someone on watch starts to get an off feeling. Depending on perception rolls, they may or may not see the eyes watching from up in the trees, though they disappear just after being noticed. Additionally, they may hear the sound of leathery wings gliding through the air above them. Finally, after their defenses being lightly probed/tested, a creature attacks. (IIRC)I used a giant flying chupacabra from PF, but whatever works for you. The creature goes down relatively easily, but as it is struck down, it lets out a piercing scream. As uiet settles, the party hears answering cries from deeper in the woods");

 "Souls of the dead get confused and head towards you rather than onto their next life. You are easily haunted or possessed, but anyone who died within 60 feet of you has their revival time limit tripled (depending on the spell). If someone died while you were touching them, they have an extra day to be raised.",

 "You are a natural with necromantic magic. Make arcana checks about Necromancy with advantage. You also learn one necromantic cantrip.",
 "You can shape the stuff of shadows into semi-real objects. Unlike prestidigitation, you can craft small shadowstuff things that move and imitate life, but these normally seek to return to the shadows rather than obey the will of their creator. Shadowstuff crafts are easily identified by the smoky wisps they emanate and sunlight dissipates them. Crafting shadowstuff requires no components other than shadows and your breath.",

Roll a d6) 1: Your shadow is missing, 2: Your shadow stretches toward the sun, 3: Your shadow resembles a shambling corpse, 4: Your shadow resembles a young child with a broken limb, 5: Your shadow resembles an unidentifiable horrifying beast, 6: Your shadow resembles the grim reaper, flowing cloak and scythe to match.",
 "Your shadow autonomously collects interesting things for you and puts them in your pocket when people arent looking. It especially likes looking in forgotten dark places. Most found items are worthless or low value: stray copper, mice skulls, broken glass, dead beetles, dropped beads, etc. Your shadow respects other peoples property ... most of the time.",

 "At night, everyones eyes appear black and their faces slowly begin to disfigure if you stare too long. (This is only visible to you).",
 "You have the feeling of having lost someone in the Shadowfell, but you cant remember anything about this person, not even the name.",
 "You require a night light, or absolute darkness, or a security object (such as a treasured blanket or a knife under your pillow) to gain the benefits of a long rest.",
 "You have trouble sleeping at night but feel rather drowsy during the day. You have become nocturnal.",
 "Your spirit continues to wander the Shadowfell when you sleep.",
 "You can possess peoples dreams, causing nightmares.",

 "You have a 10% chance of having a nightmare, which results in 8-hour rests having the effect of 4-hour rests.",

 "At a certain regular time of day (e.g. Midnight), you become ethereal for 1 minute. You are partially connected to the Shadowfell during this time.",

Soft, upbeat music is constantly being played by a talented bard in one of the room’s corners, which somehow gives the caster a feeling of home. There are always enough patrons that the inn feels lively but not uncomfortably crowded, and waiters and waitresses bustle around providing delicious drinks and hearty meals. An innkeeper immediately rushes over to the caster and informs them that their room has been covered, as well as all their food and drink. As the inn’s fare fills the caster’s belly and the patrons begin to socialize with them, the caster becomes less and less inclined to leave. In actuality, the inn and all its original occupants are part of a small sentient pocket dimension that feeds off of feelings of contentment and satisfaction. The pocket dimension snatched the caster up in the hopes of keeping them inside it as a permanent source of sustenance. Exiting through the far door instantly transports the caster to their intended destination.",

After one minute, the clone pops out of existence at the same time the caster is teleported to the position of the clone.",
 "A violent, fiery explosion occurs at the point of casting as the caster rapidly shoots into the sky, breaking every surface in their way. The caster disappears into the clouds and descends to their intended point of teleportation one turn later, breaking all surfaces along the way and causing a similar explosion to the first at their point of impact. All creatures within a 15 foot radius Sphere other than the caster must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.

You can see where they they are, floating as specters/ghosts. But as soon as you attempt to approach them, you feel you soul and body get hot as your dragged away and teleported to the original desired location. No time has passed since. Any party members teleporting with you did not feel this effect, only the one who cast the teleport spell experienced it. Roll a d20. If the result is Even, nothing happens.

 "Grush: Made of the bladders of large sea-life, this coastal inn sells this oily black beverage in large serving sizes. It is extremely potent, and had it not been for its fluidity, it would be extremely hard to keep down. If spilled, you must make a Dexterity DC10 Saving Throw to not slip on the tile it was dropped on or fall prone.",
 "Dwarven Tomb: Also called a Pondahl Tafone by elitists who dont want to sound like a ruffian when they order it, this drink is a dwarven-made black mead. Besides its blackcurrants, it has a very earthy flavor and a grit to it. While someone who calls it a Pondhal Tafone would likely explain to you in depth that the earthy flavor and grittiness comes from a complicated and sophisticated fermenting process involving fresh roots that only a trained pallette can detect, the validity of this claim could be brought into question as the beverage is traditionally served in an unhewn stone cup.

 "Borovian Wine: A rich blood red in colour, the bartender doesnt remember ordering it, but found it in the cellar so figured he might as well sell it. Not suspicious at all.",
 "Beholders Tears: A clear spirit that causes very vivid dreams the next time the drinker sleeps. Actually just made from a plant know for its hallucinatory effects but that doesnt make for an exciting name.",
 "The Princess: A reddish spirit with a fruity taste. Because of the sweetness, the colour and that is sometimes served with some flower inside the glass, some people may think of it as weak, but is extremely potent and usually a few glasses are enough to wake up the morning after with no recollection of what happened.",
 "Dragonblood: A dark red wine with an addition of some spice. Its called Dragonblood becouse of the colour, the fact that is served warm, and its very spicy.",

 "Oathbeer: Dwarves drink this as part of a ceremony to seal a pact, or as a sign of friendship and devotion.

 "Wyvern 981: A viscous liquor with an indescribable taste. Some have likened it to being punched in the nose with an onion whilst a fond memory kissed you gently inside your throat.",
 "Gelatinous Gin: One curious and profitably end point in the wizardly experimentation of Curzan is this breed of gelatinous cube, bottled, intoxicating and relatively safe for consumption. This lively cousin of the Gelatinous Cube dances wildly in its bottle when it is given a little shake, as if it is sloshed itself. Sometimes brewers add flecks of precious metals like gold simply for visual effect and conspicuous extravagance. Typically served in a shot glass, the gelatinous drink goes down with a slightly paralyzing effect giving the drinker a signature raspy lisp. It is sweet from the molasses half-metabolized into alcohol (yes, its technically a rum) and flavored by other organic material added in the brewing process—berries are popular, but some adventurous combinations include ghost peppers, whole octopi and cilantro. Left too long on its own, it has been known to sneak out of the glass and crawl off a bar.",

 "Umlog and Nevell aka the beauty and the beast. Umlog is a literal troll, yet an extraordinary one. Hes as intelligent as a troll can be and actually not a bad fellow. He is well read and has particularly deep knowledge of local laws. He acquired his tavern in a remote deal via an exchange of letters. No one knew a troll was the buyer, before the deal was done. People in this area -close to the feywoods- are very keen on honoring deals and contracts and thus, somewhat begrudgingly abstained from gathering their torches and pitchforks. The success of the Green side of Life -thats the name of the tavern- is not only based on Umlogs craftiness, though. A nymph named Nevell works in the tavern at the side of Umlog. She is hospitality personified, a skilled chef, baker and singer. Nobody except them seems to know how they ended up together, but they run a really homely place in a village on the edge of civilization.",
 "Pierce Ears Moldun, a balding human with normal sized, non-pierced ears, is the owner of Sweet Relethe. He is always looking down, at the drink he is pouring, the bar he is polishing, or the food he is cooking. He is a man of few words. Tell him, Ears, I need to give away a story, and leave a proper sum on the bar. You will know what his service is worth if you truly need it. It may be expensive, but rarely more than one can pay. The price is different for every story, but if you do not offer enough, he will know after a quick glance at you. He will shake his head and continue with his work. If your coin is sufficient, he will nod his head, then get the dark blue bottle down from the top shelf. Slowly. Carefully. The bottle is beautifully made, but you find yourself unable to describe it apart from the color. He will pour a tiny shot, small as a thimble, before replacing the bottle and pulling you a beer to go with it. He will tell you that its best to drop the shot in the beer then drink it slowly as you tell your story. It is best to trust him on this. As you begin your story, he will look up at you with eyes the same color as the bottle, and you will not be able to look away. He will listen intently as you tell your story, and as the words pass your lips they will also pass out of your memory. The regulars say that even if someone is sitting right next to you, they will not hear a word, just the quiet mumbling of a slow moving river. You will leave Sweet Relethe no longer possessed by your story, not in the slightest upset at your expenditure, and quick to recommend Ears of Sweet Relethe to anyone who seems in need of his service.",

 "Arthur Art Igneous Ficer - Art is a an average sized fellow with sallow skin and sunken eyes. To give you an idea of his general appearance: despite owning a bar and inn for travelers, it looks like Art is the one that really could use some rest. But Art is a pleasant man with a passion for magically enchanted items. He gladly will talk to any traveler with such an item about the item. He finds it all fascinating. He will tell you that he used to dabble a little, but he couldnt find too many volunteers. So, he opened a bar and inn, and that pays pretty well. He keeps the price low, and that keeps travelers coming in. If you decide to stay for the night, all weapons need to be left in his care before you head up to your rooms. Hes had too many drunken fights break out in the dormitory area, he will tell you. For any party member that blacks out at the bar or decides to stay the night, the DM must roll a D4 when the party member checks out of the inn. You see, Art never did give up his love of magic item creation, and he is desperately working on figuring out how to enchant weapons and items in a single night. DM rolled a 4? Surprise! An item of yours, at the DMs choosing, has acquired a properly functioning effect, also of your DMs choosing! Rolled a 3? Well, its the same as 4, except the DM will also roll a 1d10 on your every use/attack, and a 1 will mean that your item misfired in wild magic (DMs choice). A 2? Oof. Well, it is the same as rolling a 3, except your item is completely unmagical except for the 1d10 chance of wild magic. And if the DM rolls a 1, then you were significantly robbed of either money or an item. Making magical weapons and items costs a lot, after all, and Art has a bit of rogue in him, it seems. Also, for any night a party member stays at the inn, there is a 1d6 chance of an unsatisfactorily explained small fire breaking out overnight. The following morning after such a fire, Art normally looks a little worse for wear.",

Ruddy faced, with scant blond hair and tired, grey-blue eyes. He brags that he is son of a tavernkeeper, who was son of a tavernkeeper, who was son of a fallen princess and a tavern keeper. He isnt. He also isnt Eigen Renn. In another time and a distant country he had another name, the name of a slave trader notorious for his charm and cunning. He dealt in specialties: finding just the right slave for your particular, and highly expensive taste. Children, oddities, half-breeds, even sentient monsters were all his trade. Rumor says he once sold a nobleman his own son after faking the boys death. Another says he sold two rivals to each other, then sold both to a particularly inventive necromancer.

 "They invented gunpowder and are skilled musketeers.",
 "The elves are territorial, and have an empathic connection with the rest of their tribe. This trait is given through the birthplace rather than blood.",
 "They do not bleed. Legend has it that it was made so through a wish granted to an elven hero, who swore that not a single drop of elven blood would ever be spilled again.",
 "The elves do not sleep, but rather hibernate for 500 moons every 200 years. Every settlement has elaborate sleeping chambers decorated with intricate flowery strokes going back thousands of years; before going to sleep, an elf makes another stroke. Disturbing an elfs sleep is considered a grave offense to the entire elvenkind.",
 "They have hollow bones, like birds. This makes them extremely light, but also brittle.",
 "They are born old and grow younger as they age.",
 "Their language has no tenses, as they have no concept of the passage of time.",
 "Their communities are out of phase with reality and only appear during specific astrological phenomena. Elves who leave their home village may never find it again.",
 "They sing to trees to produce and shape wood. Cutting wood from a tree or carving wood is a grievous sin with the punishment of death.",
 "They must spend at least one hour a day in pristine natural surroundings or they begin to wither and will eventually die.",
 "Bad news makes them laugh. He was murdered in front of his children? BWahahaaahaaa, thats grotesque! Hahaha. That poor child will be scarred for life.",
 "Late at night they enter a deep state of sleep for about 5 minutes. During this time their consciousness leaves their body to witness events happening around the world, but when they wake only a single image of what they saw remains in their mind.",
 "Elves were originally created by some vampire lord, using the humans living in his kingdom as a herd of breeding stock; similar to how humans created different breeds of dogs. The vampire was originally aiming for just a better tasting food source; the grace and longevity was just a happy side effect. The offshoot breed of dark elves was created when the vampires taint was mixed in by feeding on pregnant elves or having children with them, resulting in a weakness to sunlight.",
 "Elven education is based around initially students learning every discipline and subject possible and being forced to drop out of any subject in which they fall behind their peers. When they drop their final subject, they pursue this subject as a profession. Those that never drop out of a subject end up teaching it, while those who drop out entirely before adulthood are destined to do whatever work is needed, and are dismissed as failures by other elves.",
 "They frown upon the use of weapons in combat as barbaric, and exclusively fight with magic.",
 "They are extremely jealous of great works of art made by other races, and even go to war in order to destroy them.",

Their fingernails turn hard and dark until eventually they are entirely made of wood and remain motionless forever becoming a part of nature. Some elves tend to return to their family burial grove to join their ancestors resulting in forests of trees shaped like people.",
 "Its thought that there are very few Elves in the world, and they have extraordinarily long lifespans. This isnt true. There are actually many Elves with very short lifespans. Its just that there are a limited number of Elf designs. When an Elf dies, another Elf of that model takes his or her place. Thats why Elves have a reputation of being haughty and aloof; they havent forgotten your name, they just havent met you yet.",

Today they might bring magical toys to delight children, tomorrow they come with stories to entice and lure the youth to the seas, but we remember yesterday for the came with spell and steel and harrowed our village, stole our wives and husbands away for their slaves and took our silver and gold. Be afraid when the high horn calls, for it may be the first of the attacks of the Aelfar!",
 "All sustenance is liquid-based mash/paste as it unseemly to chew like animal or beast.",
 "All the language used is visual based sign and body language as they have no voice box to speak, yell, or sing. Instruments are seldom seen or heard.",
 "All minor and major wounds inflict scars do not heal on them and they cover it up with constant application of illusion magic.",
 "Slavery is the cornerstone of their civilization and all work is done by slaves except for war, education, and government functions. A yearly purge is held to keep slaves in line after several riots one millennium ago almost lead to reformation of traditional Elven way of life.",
 "As all elvenkind lost their eyes to a unknown and forgotten eldritch god, they now have unparalleled senses of smell, hearing, and taste. They operate like a mix of a blind bat and a snake as they echo-locate and smell/taste the air for tracking. They are still semi-regal but have no concept of fashion other than texture and scent.",

 "Theyre cannibalistic.",
 "When killed, an Elf can be brought back to life by returning the body to its Soul Tree. A sacrifice is made at the base of the tree and the sacrificial soul lures the Elvin soul back to the body. These Soul Trees are kept in a sacred grove that is fanatically protected by the forest elders and their Druidic apprentices. If a Soul Tree is damaged, the Elf to whom it belongs will be aware of it, regardless of distance, even on another plane of existence. If the Soul Tree is destroyed, the Elf will live on, but can never be resurrected again.",
 "The elves long lifespan is actually a combination of the lifespans of several different spirits. An elf with go through brief transition periods when it is time for them to be inhabited by a new spirit. They take new names after this transition.",
 "Their life cycle starts as a seed, which grows into a small plant, that blooms a single flower, out of which a tiny elf with butterfly wings emerges. They grow to the size of humans over 100 years, losing their wings at age 50.",
 "Their skin has animal patterns.",
 "They live in the forests for the use of lumber as a resource, not some kind of magical connection.",
 "They came from the stars, being a race that travels between different worlds (theyre aliens.)",
 "They eschew magic in favor of physical prowess.",

 "Elves began their species’ life as monsters who would steal children and eat them, over the past 200 years they have begun centralizing and stopped eating kids. There are still many wild Elf tribes left who still practice the old ways and are seen much like goblins. The Centralized Elves are trying very hard to get rid of their bad reputation.",
 "The Elves were sent down from the heavens to see that intelligent life would flourish on the planet but, were abandoned by those who sent them. The Elves through generations eventually forgot some of the reason they’re there but always remembered, they were abandoned.",
 "Elven is actually for the most part very similar to dolphin sounds. As well as this Elves can hear higher frequencies than any other intelligent species can, thus the sharp ears.",
 "Though Elves exist, many believe they are fake or just humans with sharper ears. Elves tend to get very offended when people say they don’t exist, and often hide their ears to avoid stupid questions. Elves still live longer and have magical powers, though people just believe it is just all elves looking alike and smoke and mirrors.",

 "They are connected to the land and the presence of other magical creatures interferes with the connection so (depending on the society) they either drive them off or kill them and burn all traces of it.",
 "Elves have compulsory wanderlust, they literally die if they dont see new places often. Drows are especially vulnerable to this and solve the problem by exploring the caves.",

Monitored and updated frequently by the city’s guild of artificers, Bobby is (generally) considered a force for good, although the laws he enforces do date from a couple of centuries ago. Standing at 8’ tall and 4’ wide, Bobby is certainly a force to be reckoned with. However, somewhere down the line (perhaps even in his original programming) Bobby gained a soft spot, particularly for children. When off duty (Sundays; non-negotiable) he can often be seen carrying street urchins’ round on his shoulders and provides them sweet treats with his 1 silver piece per week allowance. Bobby carries a large copper truncheon but is surprisingly capable at de-escalating violence. In the event of conflict, the general result is a swift crack to the head, and the dragging of the offending party to the local jail. Bobby can occasionally be seen playing back old recordings to himself, but it is unknown who or what he is watching; any attempts by the guild of artificers to read these memories have been politely but firmly rebuffed.",

Townspeople come and go, mostly wordlessly, dropping off items with written task instructions and stacked coins as up-front payment. You dont ever really converse with Armsy.

 "Gamma: this warforged pays little attention to the party and continues their work, Gamma’s task is to plant a forest as a last wish of a woman, to see the plains full of trees again before they were all cut down to make machinations of war (trebuchet, catapults, siege towers).

Some of the sewer tunnels expand into cisterns and reservoirs or small natural caves, while others have walls paneled with scenes of everyday town life chiseled into the brickwork.",
 "Smithy: Created during the war as an armorer and field repair Artificer, assigned to a company of dwarves. After the treaty that granted all Warforged their freedom, he continued working under the senior officer as a blacksmith, among many other trades. In armor smithing he was especially gifted, being considered a master craftsman even by the children of Moradin. The years went by and he learned more than smithing from the stout-folk. Eventually he decided to dedicate his life to pleasing Moradin with his skills, offering help to anyone in need of either his tools or his Warhammer; all while speaking the blessings of the forge.",
